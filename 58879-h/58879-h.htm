<h2><a name="Section_1" id="Section_1"><span class="spaced">1. County</span></a> and <span class="spaced">Shire. The</span> Name <span class="spaced"><em>Hertfordshire</em>. Its</span> Origin and Meaning.</h2>

<p>The only true and right way of learning geography
(which in its widest sense comprehends almost everything
connected with the earth) is to become acquainted with
the geography&mdash;or, strictly speaking, the topography&mdash;and
history of the district in which we live. Modern
England is split up into a number of main divisions known
as <em>counties</em>, and in some instances also as <em>shires</em>; the word
<em>shire</em>, when it is used, being added at the end of the
county name. Thus we have the county of Essex or
the county of Hertford; but whereas in the former case
the word <em>shire</em> is never added, it may be in the case of the
latter. We then have either the county of Hertford, or
Hertfordshire, as the full designation of the territorial unit
in which we dwell. In official documents our area is
always mentioned under the title of the “County of
Hertford”; but imperfectly educated persons when filling
in such documents frequently write the “County of
Hertfordshire.” This is wrong and superfluous; shire
being equivalent to county.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span></p>

<p>The word <em>county</em> signifies an area of which a <em>count</em> or
<em>earl</em> is the titular head. Here it may be incidentally
mentioned that the title “Earl” is of Saxon origin, which
it was attempted to replace after the Conquest by the
Norman-French “Count”; the attempt being successful
only in the case of an Earl’s consort, who is still known
as “Countess.” It also obtained in the case of “County,”
which is thus practically equivalent to “Earldom.”</p>

<p>It now remains to enquire why some counties are also
known as shires, while others are not thus designated.
In Anglo-Saxon times England, in place of being one
great kingdom, was split up into a number of petty kingdoms,
each ruled by a separate sovereign. Essex was
then a kingdom by itself, situated in the east of the
country; while Wessex was a western kingdom, and
Mercia a sovereignty more in the heart of the country.
Essex and Sussex, being small kingdoms, were constituted
counties by themselves when the country came under a
single dominion, and their names have consequently
remained without addition or alteration from Anglo-Saxon
times to our own day. The larger kingdoms, such
as Wessex and Mercia, were, on the other hand, split up
into <em>shares</em>, or <em>shires</em>,&mdash;i.e. that which is shorn or cut off&mdash;and
their names have disappeared except as items in
history. Hertfordshire, then, is in great part a <em>share</em> of
the ancient kingdom of Mercia, of which, indeed, it seems
to have formed a centre, as the Mercian kings spent at
least a portion of their time at Berghamstedt (Berkhampstead).
It is however only the larger western portion
of the county that belonged to Mercia, a smaller area on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
the eastern side originally being included in the kingdom
of Essex.</p>

<p>As to the meaning of the name Hertford, there has
been some difference of opinion among archaeologists. In
that extremely ancient chronicle, “Domesday Book,” the
name, it appears, is spelt Herudsford, which is interpreted
as meaning “the red ford.” The more general and obvious
interpretation is, however, that of “hart’s-ford,” from the
Anglo-Saxon <i lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">heort</i>, a hart, or stag; and this explanation
is supported by the occurrence in other parts of the country
of such names as Oxford, Horseford, Gatford (= goat’s-ford),
Fairford (= sheep’s-ford), and Swinford. Writing
on this subject in a paper on Hertfordshire place-names
published in 1859, the Rev. Henry Hall, after alluding to
the custom of naming fords after animals, concluded as
follows:&mdash;“At all events, the custom is so prevalent, and
the word hart so common for Anglo-Saxon localities, as
Hart’s-bath, Hartlepool (the Hart’s pool), Hartly&mdash;that
though several other derivations have been given for the
capital of the county, none seems so simple, or so satisfactory,
as that which interprets it to mean the hart’s ford.”</p>

<p>This interpretation has been adopted by that division
of His Majesty’s local forces formerly known as the
H<em>a</em>rtfordshire Militia. Possibly it is supported by the
title of a neighbouring village, Hertingfordbury, that is to
say, the stronghold near Hertingford,&mdash;the ford at the
hart’s meadow. Whether or not it has anything to do
with the matter, it may be worthy of mention that red-deer
antlers occur in considerable abundance buried in the
peat of Walthamstow, lower down the Lea valley, in Essex.</p>

<p>Hertford is an inland county, situated in the south-eastern
portion of England, and cut off from the nearest
sea by the whole width of Essex, which forms the greater
portion of its eastern border. Neither has it any great
river of its own communicating with the ocean; although
the Lea, which is navigable below Hertford, and falls into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
the Thames at Barking in Essex, affords the means of
transporting malt (the great output of Ware) and other
products to London and elsewhere by water. As to
canal communication, this will be discussed in a later
section.</p>

  </div>

<p>Originally Hertford was essentially an agricultural
county, as it is to a great extent at the present day; its
northern three-quarters being noted for its production of
corn. The southern portion, on the other hand, was partly
a hay-growing and grazing country. Nowadays, however,
more especially on the great lines of railway, conditions
have materially altered; and large areas have become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
residential districts, which in the more southern part are
little more than suburbs of the metropolis. Printing-establishments
and factories&mdash;moved from London for
the sake of cheapness&mdash;have likewise been set up on the
outskirts of many of the larger towns, such as <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans and
Watford, or even in some of the villages. On the other
hand, the old-fashioned timbered and tiled or thatched
cottages formerly so characteristic of the county are
rapidly vanishing and giving place to the modern abominations
in brick and slate. Gone, too, is the old-fashioned
and picturesque smock-frock of the labourer and the
shepherd, which was still much in evidence some five
and forty years ago, or even later; its disappearance being
accompanied by the loss of many characteristic local words
and phrases, to some of which reference will be made in
a later section. The gangs of Irish mowers and reapers
which used to perambulate the county at hay and harvest
time are likewise a feature of the past.</p>

<p>The scenery of the southern portion of the county
differs&mdash;owing to its different geological formation&mdash;very
markedly from that of the northern two-thirds; the latter
area representing what may be called typical Hertfordshire.
Although there is nothing grand or striking in the scenery
of this part, for quiet and picturesque beauty&mdash;whether of
the village with its ancient church nestling in the shelter
of the well-wooded valley, or the winding and tall-hedged
lanes (where they have been suffered to remain)&mdash;it would
be hard to beat; and in many instances is fully equal in
charm to the much-vaunted Devonshire scenery, although,
it is true, the hedge-banks lack the abundant growth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
ferns characteristic of those of the latter county. Very
characteristic of this part of the county are its open gorse
or heath commons, like those of Harpenden, Gustard
Wood, Bower’s Heath, and Berkhampstead. From the
higher chalk downs on the northern marches of the
county extensive views may be obtained over the flats of
Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire; while in like manner
the southern range of chalk hills in the neighbourhood of
Elstree presents a panoramic view over the low-lying
clay plains of the southern portion of the county and
Middlesex.</p>

<p>In former days, it may be mentioned in this place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
the inhabitants of most, if not all, of the English counties
had nicknames applied to them by their neighbours;
“Hertfordshire Hedgehogs” being the designation applied
to natives of this county, while their neighbours to the
eastward were dubbed “Essex Calves.”</p>

<p>The maximum length of Hertfordshire, along a line
running in a south-westerly and north-easterly direction,
is about twenty-eight miles; while its greatest breadth,
along a line passing near its centre from the neighbourhood
of Tring to that of Bishop’s Stortford, is very nearly
the same. Owing to its extremely irregular outline, the
county has, for its size, a very large circumference,
measuring approximately 130 miles. Here it should be
stated that the ancient area of the county differs somewhat
from that of what is now known as the administrative
county. According to the census of 1901, the area of
the ancient, or geographical county, included 406,157
acres, whereas that of the administrative county is only
404,518 acres<a name="Anchor_1" id="Anchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1.">[1]</a>, or about 630 square miles. The difference
in these numbers is due to the fact that certain portions
of the old county, such as that part of the parish of
Caddington originally included in Hertfordshire, have
been transferred to adjacent counties. The figures relating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
to population, etc. given in the sequel refer to the administrative
county.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1" title="Return to text." href="#Anchor_1">[1]</a> In the <cite>Report</cite> of the Board of Agriculture published in 1905 the
number of acres is given as 402,856; and this is taken as the basis of
calculation in section <a href="#Section_10" title="Go to section 10.">10</a> and in the <a href="#Diagrams" title="Go to diagrams.">diagrams</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>In size Hertford may be reckoned a medium county,
its acreage being rather less than that of Surrey, and about
half that of Essex.</p>

<p>To describe the shape of Hertfordshire is almost an
impossibility, on account of its extremely irregular contour;
but as its two maximum diameters are approximately
equal, it may be said to lie in a square, of which the four
angles have been cut away to a greater or less extent in a
curiously irregular manner. The reason of this irregular
outline, seeing that only the eastern border is formed to
any great extent by a river-valley, is very difficult to guess.
Where its south-eastern boundary leaves the Lea valley
in the neighbourhood of Waltham Abbey, Middlesex
gives off from Enfield Chase a kind of peninsula running
in a north-westerly direction into Hertfordshire; while,
in its turn, Hertfordshire, a short distance to the south,
sends a better-marked and irregular peninsula (in which
stands Chipping Barnet) jutting far into Middlesex. In
consequence of this interlocking arrangement, a portion
of Hertfordshire actually lies to the south of a part of
Middlesex, although, as a whole, the former county is
due north of the latter. Another, but narrower, projection
runs from the south-western corner of the county
in the neighbourhood of Rickmansworth so as to cut off
the north-western corner of Middlesex from Buckinghamshire;
while a third prominence, in which Tring is
situated, is wedged into Buckinghamshire from the
western side of the county. Other minor projections<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
occur on the north-western and northern border, of
which the most pronounced is the one north of Baldock,
jutting in between Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire.</p>

<p>As regards boundaries, Hertfordshire is bordered on
the east by Essex, by Middlesex on the south, by
Buckinghamshire on the south-west, by Bedfordshire on
the north-west, and, to a small extent, by Cambridgeshire
on the north. From a short distance below the Rye
House to Waltham Abbey the boundary between Hertfordshire
and Essex is a natural one, formed by the rivers
Stort and Lea; but the other boundaries of our county
are, for the most part at any rate, purely artificial.</p>

<p>It should be added that these boundaries at the present
day do not everywhere accord with those of half a century
ago. The parish of Caddington was, for instance, in
former days partly in Hertfordshire and partly in Bedfordshire,
but under the provisions of the Local Government
Act of 1888, confirmed in 1897, the whole of it was
included in the latter county. Certain other alterations
were made about the same time in the boundary.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="Section_4" id="Section_4"><span class="spaced">4. Surface</span></a> and General Features.</h2>

<p>The contours of a district depend almost entirely upon
the nature of its geological formations, and the action of
rain, rivers, and frost upon the rocks of which they are
composed. These formations in the case of this county
are briefly described in a later section. Here it must
suffice to state that hard slaty rocks form jagged mountain
ranges, while soft limestones like our Hertfordshire chalk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
weather into rounded dome-like hills and ridges, and
heavy clays form flat plains. As the bed-rock, or, as we
may say, foundation, of Hertfordshire, is constituted either
by chalk or clay, it is the two latter types of scenery that
mainly characterise this county. It is only, however, on
the north-western and northern borders of the county, as
at Ivinghoe in Bucks, or between Sandon and Pirton, that
we find typical chalk scenery, where the downs forming
the north-easterly continuation of the Chiltern Hills of
Buckinghamshire enter our own area. Here we find the
rounded downs and hollow combes characteristic of the
South and North Downs of the south-eastern counties;
and the same absence of woods, except where artificial
foresting has been attempted. Some approach to true
chalk scenery is likewise shown on the line of hills
on the London side of Elstree, where they overlook the
clay plain forming this part of northern Middlesex.
There is, however, a difference in the scenery of this
part as compared with that of the downs to the north in
that these hills are partially covered with a capping of clay
or gravel, while the beds or layers of which the chalk is
composed slope towards the plains at the base of the
ridge instead of in the opposite direction (see section on
<a href="#Section_6" title="Go to section 6."><span class="smcap">Geology</span></a>).</p>

<p>Elsewhere the chalk is covered over to a greater or
less degree, alike on the hills and in the valleys, with
thick deposits of clay, sand, and gravel. These communicate
to the hills and valleys a contour quite different
from that of chalk downs; and in many parts of the
county we have a series of more or less nearly parallel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
lines of low undulating hills separated by wide, open
valleys. Examples of this type of scenery are conspicuous
in walking from the valley of the Ver at Redbourn across
the hill on which Rothamsted stands, then descending
into the riverless valley of Harpenden, again crossing the
hill to the east of the latter, and then descending into the
valley of the Lea near the Great Northern railway station.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <img width="550" height="385" src="images/i_012.jpg" alt="A Typical Hertfordshire Village: Much Hadham" id="i_012" />
    <p class="caption">A Typical Hertfordshire Village: Much Hadham</p>
  </div>

<p>This capping of clay permits the growth of forest on
the hills, as do the alluvial deposits in the valleys; so that
in its well-wooded character the scenery of the greater
part of the county is altogether different from that
characterising the bare North and South Downs and
the Chiltern Hills. Where the chalk comes near the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
surface there is a marked tendency to the growth of
beech-trees, splendid examples of which may be seen in
Beechwood Park. Elsewhere in the chalk districts the
elm is the commonest timber-tree; although it should be
said that this species of tree was originally introduced into
England from abroad.</p>

<p>Reference has already been made to the numerous
open commons dotted over the chalk area of Hertfordshire.
These appear to have been left as open spaces at
the time the country was enclosed, owing to the sterility
of their soil, which is unsuited for growing good crops
of either corn or grass. Many of these commons, as
in the neighbourhood of Harpenden, were enclosed some
time previous to the battle of Waterloo, when corn in
this country was so dear, and every available piece of land
capable of growing wheat consequently of great value.
It may be presumed that the commons with the best soil
were selected for enclosure; but most of such enclosed
commons produce inferior crops, partly, it may be, owing
to the plan on which they are cultivated. Till twenty
years ago or thereabouts all such commons in the writer’s
own neighbourhood were divided into a number of parallel
strips, separated by grass “baulks”; these strips representing
the respective shares of the copyholders of the
district, who had the right of grazing on the original
common. The absence of hedges rendered it necessary
that the same kind of crop should be grown each year on
every plot. This made it not worth the while of the
occupiers to spend money on high cultivation. Of late
years many of these enclosed commons have either been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
built over, or come under a single ownership, thereby
obliterating one more interesting page in the history of
the county.</p>

<p>To the south of the Elstree range of chalk hills
the scenery suddenly changes, and on emerging into
Middlesex from the tunnel through these hills on the
Midland Railway we enter an extensive grassy plain,
characterised by its abundance of oak trees, the scarcity
of elms, and the total absence of ash. Parts of this plain,
which is continued through Middlesex to London, form
the great grass-growing and hay-producing district of
Eastern Hertfordshire.</p>

<p>A plain very similar in character to that south of
Elstree is entered upon to the northward of Baldock, just
after leaving the line of chalk hills, although the greater
portion of this northern plain is situated in Cambridgeshire
and Bedfordshire. When travelling northward from
London by the Great Northern Railway, observant persons,
after passing through the tunnels traversing the chalk
hills north of Hitchin, cannot fail to notice the general
flatness of the country as this great plain is entered.
Although so like the southern plain in general appearance,
this northern plain, as is noticed in the section on <a href="#Section_6" title="Go to section 6.">Geology</a>,
is composed of much older rocks.</p>

    <p class="caption">Bancroft, Hitchin</p>
  </div>

<p>The heights of some portions of the chalk area above
mean sea-level are, for this part of England, considerable.
Thus Great Offley Church is 554 feet, <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Peter’s Church,
<abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans, 402 feet, Stevenage 306 feet, Hitchin Church
216 feet, while a hill near Therfield attains the height of
525 feet. Hastoe Hill near Tring is 709 feet.</p>

<h2><a name="Section_5" id="Section_5"><span class="spaced">5. Watershed. Rivers.</span></a></h2>

<p>In commencing this section it will be well to devote
a few lines to the proper meaning of the frequently misunderstood
term “watershed.” It means the line of
water-division, or water-parting; that is to say the line
along a range of hills from which the streams flow in one
direction on one side, and in the opposite direction on
the other. The ridge-tiles on a roof form an excellent
illustration of a watershed.</p>

<p>Every local stream is separated from the one nearest
to it by a watershed; while a river-system, such as that
of the Thames, is separated by a much more important
watershed from the other river-systems which take their
origin near its source. Such river-systems, each enclosed
by a single watershed which it shares with its neighbours,
are known as drainage-areas, or catchment-basins.</p>

<p>Practically the whole of Hertfordshire lies in the
Thames drainage-area. At first sight it would be natural
to suppose that the summit of the line of chalk downs
forming the continuation of the Chiltern Hills in the
neighbourhood of Tring and continuing thence to
Dunstable would constitute the watershed between two
river-systems. But this is not the case, for the Thames
cuts through the Chiltern Hills between Wallingford
and Pangbourne, and thus receives the drainage of both
the northern and the southern flanks of that range.
The watershed formed by the continuation of the
Chilterns in the Tring district is therefore one of
second-rate importance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span></p>

<p>On the other hand, in the chalk hills near Hitchin
we have a watershed of first class, or primary rank, for it
divides the Thames catchment-area from that of the Great
or Bedfordshire Ouse, which flows into the North Sea
miles away from the estuary of the Thames. Only four
comparatively small streams flowing into the Ouse basin
lie for part or the whole of their course within the limits
of the county. The first of these is the Pirre, or Purwell,
a small brook which rises in the parish of Ippolits, and,
after passing Much Wymondley, flows into the Hiz near
Ickleford. The Hiz itself rises in a spring at Wellhead,
a short distance southward of Hitchin (formerly also
called Hiz), and after receiving the Purwell, flows to
Ickleford, where it leaves the county, being joined in
Bedfordshire by the Ivel, which rises not far from
Baldock, passing Biggleswade to join the Ouse. Below
Biggleswade it flows through Tempsford, where it unites
with the Ouse. The last of the four streams belonging to
the Ouse system is the Rhee (a Saxon term signifying a
water-course or river), which springs strongly from the
chalk a short distance west of Ashwell, and after passing
Accrington Bridge and crossing the Ermine Street, eventually
falls into the Cam.</p>

<p>The whole of the remaining rivers of the county belong
to the Thames catchment-area. With the exception
of the Thame, to be mentioned immediately in a separate
paragraph, these form two main systems, namely that of
the Colne draining the western and that of the Lea the
northern and eastern part of the county; the watershed
between these two systems running in a north-westerly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
and south-easterly direction between <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans and
Hatfield, and thence to the north of Chipping Barnet.</p>

<p>The Thame is almost entirely a Buckinghamshire
river, but it rises in our county and runs on the north
side of the great watershed formed by the continuation of
the Chiltern Hills; this watershed constituting a broad,
nearly waterless belt separating the catchment-area of the
upper Thame from that of the Lea. The Thame itself
springs from three heads in the parish of Tring; the first
of these rising near the vicarage, the second at a spot
called Dundell, and the third in a spring known as
Bulbourne. The three become united at New Mill,
whence, after passing through Puttenham, the Thame
flows by Aylesbury, in Buckinghamshire, and from there
continues its course till it eventually joins the Thames
near the village of Dorchester, a considerable distance
below Oxford.</p>

<p>Of the tributaries of the Colne system, the most
important is the Ver (or Verlume), which rises some
distance to the east of Cheverell’s Green, on the Watling
Street, and passes through the village of Flamstead, and
thence near the line of the high road to Redbourn, where
it is joined by an intermittent stream, or “bourne,”
known as the Wenmer, or Womer. The latter crosses
the road from Harpenden to Redbourn at the foot of
a steep descent; and in the old days its appearance as
a running stream was believed to forbode a death, or
“some extremity of dangerous import.” From Redbourn
the Ver continues its course by way of Shafford
Mill, at which place it crosses the high road, to <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
where it passes between the present city and the ruined
walls of ancient Verulam, to which latter it is generally
believed to have given its name. Thence its course is
continued through the old nunnery of Sopwell (of which
it supplied the extensive fish-ponds), and from that point it
flows through Park Street to join the Colne near Colney
Street; the latter stream giving the name to the united
rivers, although the Ver is considerably the larger of the
two constituents. The Colne itself rises in the neighbourhood
of Tittenhanger, between <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans and
Hatfield, and passes through London Colney on its way
to join the Ver. Near Watford the Colne receives an
important tributary in the shape of the Gade, which
issues from the chalk in the meadows of Great Gaddesden
(to which and Gadebridge it gives the name), and after
passing through Hemel Hempstead and Nash Mills, is
joined at Two Waters by the Bulbourne. The latter
rises at Tring very close to the Bulbourne source of the
Thame (the watershed being here very narrow), and
runs by way of the Frith, Dagnalls, Aldbury Meads,
Dudswell Bottom, and North Church to the north-east
side of Berkhampstead, where its volume is increased by
two important springs, and thence to Two Waters.
There is also an intermittent stream known as the
Hertfordshire Bourne, which, when running, flows into
the Bulbourne about halfway between Berkhampstead
and Boxmoor. It is reported&mdash;and apparently correctly&mdash;to
flow on the average once in every seven years; the
point from which it flows may be higher up or lower down
in the valley according to the amount of water discharged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span></p>

<p>Below Two Waters the Gade (as the united stream
is now called) passes through Kings Langley, Hunton
Bridge, and Cassiobury Park to join the Colne between
that park and Watford. After skirting the north side of
Moor Park immediately below the last-named town, the
Colne receives the Chess (giving the name to Chesham,
in Buckinghamshire), which passes through Sarratt in our
own county. The Colne then reaches Rickmansworth,
where it forms the boundary between Buckinghamshire
and Middlesex, and thence flowing by way of Uxbridge
and Colnbrook, discharges itself into the Thames above
Staines, after a course of about thirty-five miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span></p>

  <div class="figcenter">

    <p class="caption">Netting the Gade, Cassiobury Park</p>
  </div>

<p>We pass next to the basin of the Lea or Luy, the
Logodunum or Logrodunum of the ancient Britons, and
the largest river in the county. The Lea itself takes
origin in a marsh at Leagrave, or Luigrave, a little north
of Luton (= Lea-town), in Bedfordshire, and after passing
through Luton Hoo, in that county, where it is expanded
into a large artificial lake, enters Hertfordshire at East
Hyde, in the valley north of Harpenden, and flows thence
by way of Wheathampstead and Brocket (where it again
expands into another artificial lake) to Hatfield, whence
its course is continued by way of Essendon and the north
side of Bayfordbury Park to Hertford. Just before
entering the county town the Lea receives the Mimram,
or Marran, which rises in the parish of Kings Walden,
to the north-west of the Bury, and flows to the eastward
of Kimpton Hoo, and thence by way of Codicote,
Welwyn, Digswell (with added supplies from local
springs), Tewin Water, and Hertingfordbury to its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
junction with the Lea close to Hertford. In the upper
part of its course the Mimram receives the small brook
known as the Kime, from which Kimpton and Kimpton
Hoo take their names.</p>

<p>In Hertford the Lea is divided into two channels,
one of which runs through the eastern portion of the
town to cross Great Hertham common, while the other,
which is navigable, passes along the western side to join
its fellow at the aforesaid common.</p>

<p>At about one-third the distance between Hertford and
Ware the Lea is largely augmented by the waters of the
Beane (Benefician) and the Rib, which join close to their
union with the main river. The Beane rises from a ditch
in the parish of Ardeley (between Stevenage and Buntingford),
and thence flows in a southward direction by way
of Walkern, Aston, Frogmore, Watton, and Stapleford,
passing on its way through Woodhall Park, at the
entrance to which it is reinforced by several strong
springs. Between Watton and Stapleford it also receives
a small brook flowing from Bragbury End.</p>

<p>Starting in an easterly direction from Ardeley or
Walkern, we shall cross the low watershed dividing the
valley of the Beane from that of the Rib; which latter
takes its rise near Reed, and after crossing the Ermine
Street at the south end of Buntingford, flows by way of
West Mill and New Bridge to Braughing, where it is
joined by the Quin, which issues from a spring at
Barkway, and passing by Hormead and Quinbury (to
which it lends its name), reaches Braughing Priory.
Below Braughing the Rib, as it is now called, flows by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
way of Hammels, Standon, Barwick, Thundridge, to
cross the Ermine Street at Wade’s Mill, and thence <i>viâ</i>
Ware Westmill and Ware Park to join the Lea with the
Beane.</p>

<p>From Luton to Hatfield the course of the Lea
pursues a generally south-easterly direction; at Hatfield
it becomes for a short distance due east, and then trends
to the north-east through Hertford to Ware. Here it
takes a sudden bend, so that the remainder of its course
through the county and the adjacent portion of Essex is
almost due south. A direct line from Luton to the Lea
near Waltham Abbey measures about 40 miles; but,
owing to its great north-easterly bend, the course of the
Lea between these two points is something like 45 miles.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <img width="550" height="366" src="images/i_024.jpg" alt="Bishop’s Stortford" id="i_024" />
    <p class="caption">Bishop’s Stortford (showing the Plain Country)</p>
  </div>

<p>The last two rivers on our list are the Ash and the
Stort, both of which in the upper part of their courses run
from north to south nearly parallel with the Beane and the
Quin. The Ash rises near Brent Pelham and thence
flowing by Much Hadham and through the parish of
Widford, falls into the Lea above Stanstead Abbots.
The Stort, which is the most easterly tributary of the
Lea in the county, is of Essex origin, taking its rise at
the very border of the county, near Meesdon, and
entering it again close to Bishop’s Stortford. Some
distance above Stortford it receives one tributary from
the Essex and a second from the Hertfordshire side,
the latter forming for a short distance the boundary
between the two counties. At Stortford the Stort is
wholly within Hertfordshire, but a little below the town
it forms the county boundary for a considerable distance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
passing by way of Sawbridgeworth on the Hertfordshire,
and Harlow on the Essex side, to join the Lea a short
distance below the Rye House. From this point and
Hoddesdon nearly to Waltham Abbey the Lea forms the
boundary between Hertfordshire and Essex, finally leaving
the former county near Waltham. The river now
constitutes the line of division between Middlesex and
Essex, finally joining the Thames below Bow Bridge, at
Barking, after a course of 45 miles.</p>

<p>Here may conveniently be mentioned the celebrated
Chadwell spring, near Hertford, which after supplying
London with a large amount of water by way of the
New River (of which more in a later chapter) for three
hundred years, failed temporarily in 1897, so that water
began to flow into, instead of out of its basin. Previous to
this failure the amount of water discharged daily by the
Chadwell spring was estimated at not less than 2,600,000
gallons. In addition to the temporary failure of Chadwell,
a spring in Woolmers Park, near Hertford, has of late
years completely dried up; both these failures being
attributed mainly, if not entirely, to the tapping of the
Hertfordshire water-supply by the deep borings in London.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="Section_6" id="Section_6"><span class="spaced">6. Geology</span></a> and Soil.</h2>

<p>By Geology we mean the study of the rocks, and we
must at the outset explain that the term <em>rock</em> is used by
the geologist without any reference to the hardness or
compactness of the material to which the name is applied;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
thus he speaks of loose sand as a rock equally with a hard
substance like granite.</p>

<p>Rocks are of two kinds, (1) those laid down mostly
under water, (2) those due to the action of fire.</p>

<p>The first kind may be compared to sheets of paper
one over the other. These sheets are called <em>beds</em>, and such
beds are usually formed of sand (often containing pebbles),
mud or clay, and limestone or mixtures of these materials.
They are laid down as flat or nearly flat sheets, but may
afterwards be tilted as the result of movement of the
earth’s crust, just as you may tilt sheets of paper, folding
them into arches and troughs, by pressing them at either
end. Again, we may find the tops of the folds so produced
worn away as the result of the wearing action of
rivers, glaciers, and sea-waves upon them, as you might
cut off the tops of the folds of the paper with a pair of
shears. This has happened with the ancient beds forming
parts of the earth’s crust, and we therefore often find them
tilted, with the upper parts removed.</p>

<p>The other kinds of rocks are known as igneous rocks,
which have been molten under the action of heat and
become solid on cooling. When in the molten state
they have been poured out at the surface as the lava of
volcanoes, or have been forced into other rocks and cooled
in the cracks and other places of weakness. Much
material is also thrown out of volcanoes as volcanic ash
and dust, and is piled up on the sides of the volcano.
Such ashy material may be arranged in beds, so that it
partakes to some extent of the qualities of the two great
rock groups.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span></p>

<p>The relations of such beds are of great importance to
geologists, for by means of these beds we can classify the
rocks according to age. If we take two sheets of paper,
and lay one on the top of the other on a table, the upper
one has been laid down after the other. Similarly with
two beds, the upper is also the newer, and the newer will
remain on the top after earth-movements, save in very
exceptional cases which need not be regarded here, and
for general purposes we may look upon any bed or set of
beds resting on any other in our own country as being
the newer bed or set.</p>

<p>The movements which affect beds may occur at
different times. One set of beds may be laid down flat,
then thrown into folds by movement, the tops of the
beds worn off, and another set of beds laid down upon the
worn surface of the older beds, the edges of which will
abut against the oldest of the new set of flatly deposited
beds, which latter may in turn undergo disturbance and
renewal of their upper portions.</p>

<p>Again, after the formation of the beds many changes
may occur in them. They may become hardened, pebble-beds
being changed into conglomerates, sands into sandstones,
muds and clays into mudstones and shales, soft
deposits of lime into limestone, and loose volcanic ashes
into exceedingly hard rocks. They may also become
cracked, and the cracks are often very regular, running in
two directions at right angles one to the other. Such
cracks are known as <em>joints</em>, and the joints are very important
in affecting the physical geography of a district. Then,
as the result of great pressure applied sideways, the rocks
may be so changed that they can be split into thin slabs,
which usually, though not necessarily, split along planes
standing at high angles to the horizontal. Rocks affected
in this way are known as <em>slates</em>.</p>

<p>If we could flatten out all the beds of England, and
arrange them one over the other and bore a shaft through
them, we should see them on the sides of the shaft, the
newest appearing at the top and the oldest at the bottom,
as shown in the figure. Such a shaft would have a
depth of between 10,000 and 20,000 feet. The strata are
divided into three great groups called Primary or Palaeozoic,
Secondary or Mesozoic, and Tertiary or Cainozoic, and the
lowest of the Primary rocks are the oldest rocks of Britain,
which form as it were the foundation stones on which
the other rocks rest. These may be spoken of as the
Pre-Cambrian rocks. The three great groups are divided
into minor divisions known as systems. The names of
these systems are arranged in order in the table with
a very rough indication of their relative importance,
though the divisions above the Eocene have their thickness
exaggerated, as otherwise they would hardly show in
the figure. On the right hand side, the general characters
of the rocks of each system are stated.</p>

<p>With these preliminary remarks we may now proceed
to a brief account of the geology of the county.</p>

<p>In Hertfordshire, apart from the soil and the superficial
accumulations of gravel, sand, and clay, only the
lower beds or strata of the Tertiary and the uppermost
formations of the Secondary period are represented.</p>

<p>As the greater portion of the subjacent rocks of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
county is formed by the Chalk, it will be convenient
to commence with this formation. The Chalk extends, or
“strikes,” across all but the south-eastern portion of the
county in a broad belt, with a general south-westerly or
north-easterly direction, reaching on the northern side,
with a few exceptions, to the border of the county and
beyond, while to the southward its boundary runs approximately
through Bushey, South Mims, Hertford, and
Bishop’s Stortford. At Dunstable the Chalk forms what is
called an “escarpment,” that is to say a high and somewhat
precipitous (although rounded) cliff overlooking the great
plain formed by the marls and clays of the underlying
strata. As in all true escarpments, the beds, or strata of
the Chalk, which are somewhat tilted by earth-movements
out of their originally horizontal plane, incline, or “dip”
away from the main face of the cliff, that is to say, towards
the south-east; and this south-easterly dip of the Chalk,
apart from local interruptions and folds, continues to its
southerly boundary. Now since the Chalk is a porous
formation admirably fitted to collect and retain the rain-water
falling upon it, while it is underlain, as we shall
see shortly, by the impervious Gault Clay of the Bedfordshire
plain, and overlain along its southern boundary by
the equally impervious London Clay, it is obvious that
it will hold all the water thus collected, and that this
water will tend to run deep down in the rock in a south-easterly
direction. Hence the northern part of the Chalk
zone forms an almost perfect water-collecting area, which
can be tapped along the southern side of the county by
boring through the overlying London Clay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span></p>

<p>The Chalk comprises several main divisions, of which
the highest is known as the Upper Chalk, or the Chalk
with flints; this when fully developed being about
300 feet thick. It is a soft white limestone traversed by
nearly horizontal layers of black, white-coated flint, which
have originated by a process of “segregation” in the rock
subsequent to its deposition as ooze on the old sea-bed.
Usually these layers consist of irregular nodular masses;
but there is sometimes a continuous thin layer of scarcely
more than half-an-inch in thickness, locally known as
“chimney-flint.” The south-easterly dip of the Chalk is
shown by the layers of flint to be not more, as a rule, than
three or four degrees. The Upper Chalk extends from
the summits of the hills as far down as Rickmansworth,
Watford, Hatfield, and Hertford, thus forming the bed-rock
of the greater portion of the county. By the wearing
away of the overlying Tertiary strata, a small cone, or
“inlier,” of Chalk is exposed at Northaw.</p>

<p>Next comes a bed of about four feet thick known as
the Chalk-rock. It is a hard cream-coloured rock, containing
layers of green-coated nodules, is traversed by
numerous vertical joints, and rings to the stroke of the
hammer. Owing to its hardness, it resists the action of
the weather, and is therefore in evidence at or near the
summits of the hills, where it can be traced from close to
Berkhampstead Castle by Boxmoor and Apsley, and thence
to the south-west of Dunstable, Kensworth, the south of
Baldock, and so in a north-easterly direction to Lannock
Farm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span></p>

  <div class="figcenter">

    <p class="caption">View on the Downs looking towards Wallington from
    the Icknield Way</p>
  </div>

<p>Below the Chalk-rock we come to the Middle Chalk,
or Chalk without flints, which may be so much as
350 feet in thickness, and rises in a rather steep slope
or “step” from the underlying beds to be next mentioned.
Flints are few and far between in the Middle Chalk,
which forms the western slope of the Downs at Royston,
as well as beyond the limits of the county at Luton, and
so on to the Chiltern Hills. Fossils are much more
numerous in the Middle than in the Upper Chalk. The
lowest bed of the former is the Melbourn Rock, a hard,
nodular band about 10 feet thick. Next comes the grey
and white Lower Chalk, from 65 to 90 feet thick, after
which we reach the Totternhoe Stone. Although only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
six feet in thickness, this Totternhoe Stone, which forms
the escarpment of Royston Downs, is of importance as
having been largely employed in the construction of
churches and other buildings on the northern side of the
county. It is a sandy grey limestone, which used to be
largely quarried at Totternhoe, with special precautions
in drying. It can be traced from Tring by way of
Miswell, Marsworth, Pirton, and Radwell to Ashwell.</p>

<p>The Totternhoe Stone really forms the top of the
Chalk-marl, which is some 80 feet thick, and consists of
buff crumbling marly limestones. It forms a strip of low
ground at the base of the Chalk escarpment. At the
bottom of the Chalk occurs the so-called coprolite-bed,
which contains large quantities of phosphate nodules.
Forty years ago these beds were extensively worked
between Hitchin and Cambridge for the sake of the
nodules.</p>

<p>Only on the northern border of the county, between
Hitchin and Baldock, and also near Tring and then merely to a very small
extent, are any of the beds underlying the Chalk exposed.
These comprise, firstly the Upper Greensand, which is
either a sandy marl or a sandstone with green grains, and
secondly, a dark blue impervious clay known as the Gault.
These formations constitute the plain at the foot of the
Chalk hills in Bedfordshire, the scenery of which is very
similar to that of the London Clay plain in eastern
Hertfordshire and Middlesex.</p>

<p>It is important to add that, at a gradually increasing
depth as we proceed south, the Gault underlies the whole
of the Hertfordshire Chalk, and renders the latter such an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
excellent water-bearing formation. If the Gault be perforated
we come upon the Lower Greensand, another
excellent water-bearing stratum, which comes to the
surface in the neighbourhood of Silsoe, in Bedfordshire.</p>

<p>We may now turn to the formations overlying the
Chalk in the southern half of the county. Here it should
be mentioned that all the formations hitherto described
overlie (or underlie) one another in what is termed conformable
sequence; that is to say, there is no break
between them, but a more or less nearly complete passage
from one to another. Between the Chalk and the
overlying Tertiary formations, there is, on the other
hand, a great break or “unconformity”; the surface of
the Chalk having been worn into a very irregular contour,
above which we pass suddenly to the Tertiary beds,
generally containing at their base a number of rolled chalk
flints. This indicates that before the Tertiary beds were
laid down, the Chalk had become dry land; after which
a portion of it once more subsided beneath the ocean.
The Tertiary beds are in fact formed for the most part
from the <i>débris</i>, or wearing away of the old Chalk land.</p>

<p>The lowest Tertiary stratum of eastern and southern
Hertfordshire is known as the Woolwich and Reading
beds. These consist of alternations of bright-coloured
plastic clays and sandy or pebble-beds; their maximum
thickness in the county being about 35 feet. They form
a band extending from Harefield Park to Watford,
and thence to Hatfield and Hertford. Below the
Woolwich and Reading beds we come on the London
Clay, of which the basement bed contains a layer of flint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
pebbles, although the remainder of this thick formation is
a stiff blue clay, turning brown when exposed to the
action of the weather. Originally these Tertiary formations
must have extended all over the Chalk of central
Hertfordshire, as is demonstrated by the occurrence of
patches, or “outliers,” of them over a zone of considerable
width. Such Tertiary outliers occur at Micklefield Hall,
Micklefield Green, Sarratt, Abbot’s Langley, Bedmond,
Bennet’s End, and Leverstock Green, and in the northern,
or <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Peter’s portion of <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans.</p>

<p>Closely connected with these Tertiary formations is
the well-known Hertfordshire pudding-stone; a conglomerate
formed of stained flint-pebbles cemented together
by a flinty matrix as hard as the pebbles themselves, so
that a fracture forms a clean surface traversing both
pebbles and cement. This pudding-stone is usually found
in the gravels (or washed out of them) in irregular masses,
weighing from a few pounds to as many tons. It is
stated, however, to occur in its original bedding between
Aldenham and Shenley; and the rock evidently represents
a hardened zone of the Woolwich and Reading beds.
Pudding-stone is found in special abundance at <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans
and again in the neighbourhood of Great Gaddesden.
In some <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans specimens the pebbles are stained
black for a considerable thickness by the oxides of iron,
while the central core is bright red or orange. Such
specimens, when cut and polished, form ornamental
stones of great beauty; but, on account of their hardness,
the expense of cutting is very heavy.</p>

<p>Except on the higher part of the Chalk Downs, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
very generally along a narrow band half way up the sides
of the valleys, the aforesaid formations are but rarely
exposed in the county at the surface, on account of being
overlaid with superficial deposits of gravel, clay, etc.,
which are of post-Tertiary age, and were deposited for the
most part during the time that man has been an inhabitant
of the world. These superficial beds are very frequently
termed “drift,” on account of a large portion being
formed by ice, at the time that northern Europe was
under the influence of the great glacial period. Over
most of the chalk area the denuded surface of the Chalk is
covered with a thick layer of stiff clay full of flints, this
layer being formed by the disintegration of the Chalk
itself, the soluble calcareous portion being dissolved and
carried away, while the insoluble flints and clay remain.
Above this layer in the neighbourhood of Hertford,
Barnet, and elsewhere, is a series of gravelly beds assigned
to the middle division of the glacial period; while these in
turn are overlaid locally, as at Bricket Wood, between
<abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans and Watford, by the chalky Boulder-clay, of
upper glacial age, which is there some twenty feet in
thickness. In other places, as at Harpenden, the hills are
capped by a still greater thickness of clayey deposits,
mingled with flints, resting upon a very irregular surface
of Chalk, which appears to be for the most part of glacial
origin. Speaking generally, Boulder-clay is characteristic
of the east, and clay with flints and gravel of the western
side of the county.</p>

<p>Half way down the sides of the hills, in the district last
named, the Chalk is more or less completely exposed at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
surface along a narrow zone, below which we come upon
deposits of gravel, sand, and clay filling the bottoms of the
valleys. At Bowling Alley, Harpenden, these deposits are
fully forty feet in thickness. Although they have been
supposed to be the result of river action, it is more probable
that they are due to rain-wash. Indeed this is practically
proved in the case of the valley leading from Harpenden
towards No-Man’s-Land, where the lower end is blocked
by a ridge of gravel, which could not possibly have been
formed by river action. The stones in these valley-gravels
are of irregular shape, and thus quite different
from the rounded pebbles of the gravels of the Woolwich
and Reading beds, as seen at <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Peter’s, <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans. At
Harpenden the uppermost layer of valley-gravel is extremely
clean and sharp, generally of a golden yellow
colour with blackish veins. Deposits of brick-earth occur
locally throughout the Chalk area.</p>

<p>Over the greater part of the county the soil is the
result of the decomposition of the foregoing superficial
formations; and is consequently in most cases of a stiffer
and more clayey character on the hill-tops than in the
valleys, where it frequently forms only a bed of a foot, or
even less, in thickness above the sharp, running gravel.
Everywhere in the Chalk districts the soil contains a vast
number of flints; but it is, nevertheless, admirably adapted
for corn-growing, and especially for malting-grain;
Hertford being one of the four English counties best
suited to crops of the latter nature. On many of the
unenclosed commons the soil is, however, of a poor and
hungry nature, producing various kinds of inferior grass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
together with spring-flowering gorse, as on Harpenden
Common, or heather, as at Kingsbourn Green, between
Harpenden and Luton, and at Gustard Wood, near
Wheathampstead. On the higher Chalk Downs near
Dunstable and Royston there is little or no soil properly
so-called; the short, but sweet and nourishing grass
growing on the chalk itself. A very different type of
soil obtains in the London Clay area in the south and east
of the county; this being heavy and clayey, and thus
better suited for grass than for corn; in fact in the old
days the Middlesex portion of this district was known to
the country people as the “Hay-country.” Along many
of the river-valleys peaty soils of a marshy and swampy
nature prevail.</p>

<h2><a name="Section_7" id="Section_7"><span class="spaced">7. Natural</span></a> History.</h2>

<p>In former days, when the mammoth or hairy elephant,
the extinct woolly rhinoceros, and the wild ox, together
with the African hippopotamus and spotted hyaena roamed
over the Thames valley and afforded sport to our prehistoric
ancestors, England was joined to the Continent
across what is now the English Channel; so that the
animals and plants of the southern portion of our islands,
at any rate, were more or less nearly identical with those
of France and Belgium. The advent of the great ice
age, or glacial period, caused, however, a vast disturbance
of the fauna and flora (as the assemblages of animals and
plants characteristic of different countries are respectively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
termed), especially as about this time there occurred
several oscillations in the level of our country, during one
or more of which Great Britain was temporarily separated
from the Continent. How much or how little these and
other changes had to do with the poverty of the British
fauna as compared with that of the Continent is too long
and difficult a question to be discussed in this place; but
certain it is that even the southern counties of England
do possess fewer species of animals and plants than France
or Belgium; that this poverty increases with the distance
from the Continent; and that Ireland is much poorer in
species than England. It may perhaps be well to add,
although it does not really concern our subject, that there
appears to have been another land-connection by means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
of which Scotland and Ireland received a portion of their
faunas from Scandinavia by way of what is now the
North Sea.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <img width="550" height="376" src="images/i_039.jpg" alt="Six Hills, Stevenage" id="i_039" />
    <p class="caption">Six Hills, Stevenage (Danish Barrows)</p>
  </div>

<p>At the date of the final insulation of Great Britain
from the Continent there is every reason to believe that
all the land animals of the former were identical with
species inhabiting adjacent regions of the latter. And
even at the present day, when isolation has for centuries
been exerting its influence on the non-migratory (and in
some degree also on the migratory) animals, there are no
species of quadrupeds (mammals), birds, or reptiles absolutely
peculiar to our islands, with the exception of the
grouse; and in the opinion of many naturalists that bird
should be regarded rather as a local variety or race of the
willow-grouse of Scandinavia than as a distinct species.</p>

<p>Minor variations, however, characterise many, if not
indeed all, of our British quadrupeds and birds when
contrasted with their continental representatives. The
British squirrel is, for instance, very markedly distinct
from all the continental races of that animal in the matter
of colouring, while somewhat less decided differences
characterise our badger, hare, field-mice, etc. Similarly,
among birds, the British coal-tit is so decidedly distinct
from its continental representatives that it is regarded by
some naturalists as entitled to rank as a species by itself;
and minor differences from their continental cousins are
displayed by the British redbreast, bullfinch, great titmouse,
and many other resident species. Indeed, if careful comparisons
were instituted between sufficiently large series of
specimens, it is almost certain that all species of resident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
British land animals, as well as exclusively fresh-water
fishes, would display certain differences from their foreign
representatives; while in some instances, at any rate, as is
already known to be the case in regard to certain species,
more than one local race of an animal may exist in our
own islands.</p>

<p>It is, however, a question as to what is to be gained
by the recognition of such comparatively trifling local
differences in animals (and still more by assigning to them
distinct technical names), as the splitting process may be
carried to an almost endless degree. A large London
fishmonger is, for instance (as the writer is informed),
able to distinguish a Tay from a Severn or Avon salmon;
while a wholesale game-dealer will in like manner discriminate
between a Perthshire and a Yorkshire grouse.
In like manner a Hertfordshire badger or stoat may be
distinguished from their Midland or North of England
representatives; but it is difficult to see in what respect
we should be the better for the recognising of the existence
of such differences.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the fauna and flora of Hertfordshire may
be regarded for all practical purposes as more or less completely
identical with that of the south-east of England
generally; and nothing would be gained, even if space
permitted, by giving lists of the species which have been
found within the limits of our county.</p>

<p>The fauna and flora of Hertfordshire, like those of
other counties with varying geological formations, are not,
however, by any means the same everywhere. On the
contrary, there are well-marked local differences mainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
associated with what naturalists call “station”; that is
to say, differences of elevation, soil, geological formation,
climate, etc., etc. The animals and plants of the high chalk
downs in the neighbourhood of Gaddesden, Dunstable,
and Ashwell, are for instance more or less markedly
distinct from those of the lower level corn-growing areas
of the centre of the county. On these elevated tracts we
find, for example, wheatears, stone-curlews (near Tring),
blue butterflies, burnet-moths, small brown-banded white
snails, a periwinkle-like snail with a horny door to its
shell known as Cyclostoma, blue gentians, certain orchids,
and many other kinds of plants rarely or never seen on
the low grounds. The open commons and heaths, on
the other hand, as has been already mentioned, are the
home of heather and gorse, together with various distinctive
birds and reptiles, such as stonechats, whinchats,
titlarks, goldfinches, vipers, slow-worms, and lizards. In
the river-bottoms and other swampy localities we find
marsh and water-birds, such as yellow wagtails, snipes,
sandpipers, grebes (at Tring), herons, moorhens, water-rails,
coots, dabchicks, and wild duck, together with
(locally) the common grass or water snake, amber-snails,
marsh-marigolds, purple loose-strife, ragged robin, reeds,
and yellow flags.</p>

<p>Beech trees, as mentioned above, form the predominant
timber on the chalk-lands other than the high downs,
while on the heavier soils of the centre of the county
their place is mainly taken by elm and ash. On these
lowlands and other open cultivated tracts are found such
birds as partridges, corncrakes, lapwings, pipits, and larks;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
while in the coppices, hedgerows, and gardens we look
for nightingales (from which bird Harpenden takes its
name, <i lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">haerpen</i> being a nightingale and <i lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">dene</i> a valley in
Anglo-Saxon), blackcaps, whitethroats, wrens, and nuthatches;
while the woods are the resort of green and
spotted woodpeckers, wood-pigeons, jays, and pheasants.
The low grass-growing clay-plains on the southern side
of the county support, as already stated, an abundant
growth of oaks to the almost complete exclusion of other
timber trees; and this area doubtless also presents certain
peculiarities in its fauna distinguishing it from the corn-growing
tract to the north. The oaks grow to a very
great size, especially at Sacombe and Woodhall Park,
and three notable specimens in the county are Queen
Elizabeth’s oak at Hatfield, Goff’s oak at Cheshunt,
and the Panshanger oak.</p>

<p>In addition to these local peculiarities in the fauna
dependent upon elevation, geological formation, soil, and
the presence or absence of forest, there are, however,
certain others for which climate may possibly account.</p>

<p>A case in point is afforded by the distribution of stag-beetles
and magpies in the county. Both these species are
unknown in the district immediately round Harpenden,
while the former, at any rate, are likewise unknown in
the <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans district, and apparently between that city
and London. If, however, we travel from Harpenden to
the east, magpies may be met with when we reach
Codicote, while in the opposite direction they occur in
the Hemel Hempstead district. As to the exact point
where stag-beetles make their appearance in the latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
direction the writer has no information, but they are to
be met with in the neighbourhood of Rickmansworth and
elsewhere on the Buckinghamshire border, and become
quite common in that county. Grass-snakes, so far as the
writer is aware, are likewise absent from the Harpenden
neighbourhood, although on the Cambridgeshire side of
the county they are quite common, as they are across the
border.</p>

<p>If the local distribution of these species were carefully
worked out and mapped, we might perhaps be able to
account for what is at present a puzzle.</p>

<p>With the increase of population and building the wild
fauna of Hertfordshire, like that of England generally,
has been gradually becoming poorer in species&mdash;probably
indeed from the time the mammoth and the woolly
rhinoceros were exterminated, as they possibly were, by
our prehistoric ancestors. When the wolf, the bear, the
wild cat, and the beaver disappeared, is quite unknown;
but it is in comparatively modern times that the marten
has been exterminated, a solitary individual of this species
having been killed in the county within a score of miles
of London, that is to say near Watford, so recently as
December, 1872. Polecats appear to have almost if not
quite disappeared from the county, although a straggler
may occasionally enter from Buckinghamshire, where a
few still survive; and one was trapped in Ware Park
about 1885. Otters are rare, although a few occasionally
appear in the lower part of the Lea valley, and some
may enter the county from Buckinghamshire, in parts of
which they are much more common, the Buckinghamshire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
Otter-hounds having killed over a score of these animals
in 1908. Some years ago badgers were to be found in
many parts of the county, a well-known haunt previous
to 1840 being “Badger’s Dell” in Cassiobury Park.
They still occur locally in certain parts of the Buckinghamshire
side of the county, and probably elsewhere.
Foxes owe their preservation mainly to the sporting
instincts of the county gentry and farmers.</p>

<p>Among birds that have disappeared from the county,
the most to be regretted is the bustard, which in the
early part of last century was still to be found in the
neighbourhood of Royston, although the precise date of
its extermination from this part of England is unknown.
The bittern, too, is, at the very most, known only as an
occasional straggler; but a specimen was shot in a small
marshy pond on Harpenden Common some time previous
to 1860. The Royston crow, by some naturalists held
to be only a form of the common crow, has been named
from the Hertfordshire town, though a widespread species
throughout many parts of Europe.</p>

<p>Neither has extermination been confined to animals.
Fern-hunters have in some instances made a clean sweep
of certain species of ferns from many districts, if not from
the county generally; and nowadays aspleniums, shield-ferns,
polypodies, and false maidenhair (<i>trichomanes</i>) have
completely disappeared from the Harpenden high roads
and lanes; the present writer possessing in his garden
what he believes to be the sole remaining indigenous
specimen of the last-named species.</p>

<p>Among localities specially celebrated for birds in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
county are Tring reservoirs, where vast flocks of water-birds
congregate, especially in winter. Here breeds the
great crested grebe; and here, too, was shot in 1901 the
only known British example of the white-eyed pochard.
The neighbouring downs, as already mentioned, form one
of the chief English resorts of the stone-curlew, or thick-knee;
a species of especial interest on account of the
remarkable manner in which both birds and eggs assimilate
to their surroundings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span></p>

<p>Rare birds, as well as various maritime species driven
from their normal resorts by stress of weather, make their
appearance occasionally in various parts of the county, but
references to very few of such cases must suffice. During
the great visitation of sand-grouse (a bird normally characteristic
of the steppes of Central Asia) to the British
Isles in 1863, some individuals reached this county. In
the early part of last century a little auk, or rotche, was
taken on the millhead at Wheathampstead during very
severe weather; a great northern diver has been seen on
Tring reservoir; a pair of storm petrels were killed some
five-and-twenty years ago at Hemel Hempstead, where
snow-buntings have likewise been seen; while various
species of gulls from time to time put in an appearance in
winter. Among recent events of this nature the appearance
at Harpenden of an immature specimen of the great
purple heron is certainly noteworthy. In 1878 the late
Mr J. E. Littleboy had recorded 201 species of birds
from the county, and a few others have been added since,
bringing up the number to 210 in 1902.</p>

<p>In regard to fishes, it is of interest to quote the
following passage from Sir Henry Chauncy’s <cite>Historical
Antiquities of Hertfordshire</cite>, published early in the
eighteenth century. After referring to its other fish, it is
there stated, in the author’s quaint language, that the river
Lea also contains <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>“some Salmons; which (like young
Deer) have several denominations: the first Year they are
called Salmon-smelts, the second Year Salmon-sprats, the
third Year Salmon-forktails, the fourth Year Salmon-peall,
the fifth Year Salmonets, and the sixth Year Salmon; and
if these Fish had free Passage by the Mills, and thro’ the
Sluices at Waltham up the Stream towards Ware and
Hertford, where they might Spawn in fresh Water and
were carefully preserved from Pochers, they would greatly
increase in that River, and be of great benefit, as well to
the City of London as the Country; for some Water-men
have observed, that they delight in this Stream, and play
much about those Sluices at Waltham.”</p>

<p>Chauncy likewise mentions that trout from the Lea
below Hertford, where it has peaty banks, are much less
red than those from the gravelly streams of the chalk
districts.</p>

<p>For botanical purposes the county has been divided
into six districts corresponding to the river-basins; the
first two belonging to the Ouse system, and comprising
the Cam and the Ivel basins, and the other four, comprising
the Thame, the Colne, the Brent, and the Lea,
pertaining to the Thames system. Of these the Lea area
is the largest, the Colne next in size, the Ivel considerably
smaller, and the other three quite small. In some respects
the local characters of the flora are, however, better brought
out by taking the geological formations as a basis of
division. The Upper Chalk area, capped with much
Boulder-clay on the eastern, and with clay-and-flints and
gravel on the western side, corresponds very closely as
regards these divisions with the Lea and the Colne basins.
The Middle Chalk, which as we have seen is exposed
on the flanks of the continuation of the Chiltern Hills in
the north-west, is peculiar in being the only area in the
county in which grows the pasque-flower, or anemone;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
this chiefly flourishing on south-westerly slopes, as at
Aldbury Towers, near Tring. The Middle Chalk is
also the chief home of the various kinds of orchis; the
dwarf, the man, and the butterfly orchis being apparently
restricted to this formation. The Tertiary area has a
vegetation of a totally different type from the so-called
“dry-plant type” characteristic of the Chalk area, but it
cannot be further mentioned here.</p>

<p>In the five adjacent counties there occur 110 species
of flowering plants unknown in Hertfordshire. On the
other hand, Hertfordshire has about a dozen plants (exclusive
of varieties of the bramble) unknown in the
adjacent counties. Of the 893 native flowering plants of
Hertfordshire about 110 have not been recorded from
Cambridgeshire, while about 120 are wanting in Bedfordshire,
170 in Buckinghamshire, 140 in Middlesex, and
100 in Essex. These figures may, however, be subject
to considerable modification by future research. The
following passage on the relations of the Hertfordshire
flora is quoted from the <cite>Victoria History of the Counties
of England</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span></p>

<p>“Taking the number of species in any adjoining
county which are absent from Hertfordshire as the best
index of the degree of relationship, it would appear that
the flora of Bucks is the most nearly allied to that of
Herts, and that those of Cambridge and Essex are the
most divergent.... This is just what might be expected
from the physical features and geological structure of these
counties. The floras of Cambridge and Essex have also
a more northern or north-eastern facies [character] than
that of Hertfordshire, which is of a decidedly southern
type. The large number of Hertfordshire species which
have not yet been recorded from Buckinghamshire is
probably due to the flora of that county not having been
so thoroughly investigated as ours has been.”</p>

<h2><a name="Section_8" id="Section_8"><span class="spaced">8. Climate</span></a> and Rainfall.</h2>

<p>In its original sense the word climate meant the
degree of inclination of the sun’s rays at any particular
spot at a specified date; but nowadays it is employed to
designate the average type of weather experienced in a
district. In this latter sense it comprises the results of the
combined effects of temperature, atmospheric pressure, the
degree of moisture in the air, the direction and force of
the wind, and the amount of rainfall; the study of climate
constituting the science of meteorology. Although the
climate of the British Isles is of an exceedingly changeable
type, yet the average of the seasonal changes is far from
being the same in all parts of the country. Taking temperature
alone, we find, for instance, that while the average
for the whole year in Shetland is as low as 43° Fahrenheit,
in the Scilly Islands it rises to 53°. It is a very general
idea that in our islands the winter temperature of a place
depends upon whether it is situated in the north or the
south. This, however, is a mistake, the temperature
having little relation to latitude, but growing colder as we
pass from the west to the eastern side of the country; the
south of England, as a whole, being milder than the north,
not because it is the south, but because it includes such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
large extent of land in the west. The degree of elevation
above the sea-level has much to do with temperature and
the amount of moisture in the air; high lands being, as a
rule, colder and drier in winter than those lying at lower
levels. On account of the comparatively high elevation
of a considerable proportion of its area and its easterly
position, coupled with the prevalence of north-easterly and
easterly winds in spring, Hertfordshire ought to have, on
the whole, a cold and bracing climate for the greater part
of the year; and, as a matter of fact, such is the case.
Indeed, it is commonly said that northern Hertfordshire is
so cold and bracing, that only strong and robust constitutions
can stand it; but that for those blessed with such
constitutions it is one of the healthiest counties in the
kingdom.</p>

<p>Hertfordshire, however, like England on a small scale,
has local climates of its own, dependent upon differences
in elevation above the sea-level, in the amount of rainfall,
in the nature of the geological formation and soil, and
also in aspect, especially as regards protection from the
east wind in spring. The slope of a hill facing south or
south-west receives for instance far more sun in winter
than one which looks in the opposite direction; while it
also escapes the full blast of the bitter east wind. Places
situated on chalk, and above all on gravel, are drier, and
consequently&mdash;if on the same level and with a similar
aspect&mdash;also warmer than those on cold, heavy clay or
marl.</p>

<p>As if to confirm and perpetuate the above-mentioned
popular error, it happens that the northern and north-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>western
districts of the county, that is to say, those constituting
the chalk area, are very much colder and more
bracing than those to the south and east, whose substratum
is clay. This difference depends, however, not on
differences of latitude, but on the lower elevation of the
southern as compared with the northern districts, coupled
with the protection from cold winds afforded to the low
lands by the high ground. To those who are in the habit
of travelling by the Midland railway from the north-western
corner of the county to London, the differences
between the climate of the northern and the southern
districts is made self-apparent in early spring by the extraordinary
difference in the condition of the hedges and
trees on the two sides of the Elstree tunnel. It is true
that on this particular route the district south of the
tunnel is in Middlesex, but to the eastward much of
the lowland is in Herts. On the northern side of the
range of chalk-hills pierced by this tunnel the hawthorn
hedges may be seen at a certain period of the spring
to be absolutely devoid of a sign of green; while on
the opposite side they will be in full leaf. There is, in
fact, about a fortnight’s difference between the Elstree
and the Mill Hill side of this range in regard to the
development of spring-vegetation; and while the northern
side is exposed to the full force of the east wind, the
combes and valleys with a south-westerly aspect near the
summit of the opposite flank are so warm and sheltered
that hardy species of bamboo and palm will grow in the
open air almost as luxuriantly as in similar situations in
Surrey or Sussex.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span></p>

<p>We see, then, as has been well remarked, that the
division of the county, along the line indicated in the
section on its <a href="#Section_6" title="Go to section 6.">geology</a>, into two very unequal portions&mdash;namely,
a large north-western area with a relatively dry
soil and atmosphere, and a smaller south-eastern tract with
a comparatively moist soil and atmosphere&mdash;forms a sufficient
approach to an accurate climatic division.</p>

<p>Here we may mention that the daily temperature and
the amount of moisture in the air, together with the
barometric pressure and a number of other details, are
recorded at the Meteorological Office in London from
reports received from a host of observing stations (either
public or private) scattered at intervals all over the
country; and at the end of each year the averages, or
“means,” of these observations are worked out for the
British Isles and England generally, and likewise for the
various counties and other local districts. This enables
comparisons to be instituted between the climates of
different places with much greater accuracy than would
otherwise be possible.</p>

<p>In the year 1905 the mean temperature for the whole
of England was 48·7°, while that of Hertfordshire was
48·9°, as deduced from observations taken at four stations,
of which Bennington showed the lowest mean of 48·4°,
and New Barnet the highest of 50·2°. The aforesaid
county mean of 48·9° was, however, 0·6° above the
average; the average mean for a series of years thus being
47·8°, or about 1° lower than that for England generally.</p>

<p>If we turn to the map here given we notice that,
speaking generally, the rainfall of England decreases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
steadily as we pass from west to east. The moisture-laden
clouds, driven by the prevalent winds across the
Atlantic, precipitate their contents on reaching the land,
more especially if the land be high, and in consequence
the country beyond is less wet. Hertfordshire occupies
a middle position between the heavy averages of Wales
and S.W. England and the minimum of Essex and the
neighbourhood of the Wash, as we should expect. The
difference between the average of the various stations in
our country is remarkable. In the year 1905, which
is taken throughout as the basis of comparison, the
highest rainfall in England and Wales occurred at Glas
Lyn, near Snowdon, and was no less than 176·6 inches;
whereas the lowest was registered at Shoeburyness, in
Essex, this being only 14·57 inches; while the average
rainfall for Great Britain was 27·17 inches. In Hertfordshire,
as we shall see, the average in that year for the
whole county was 23·47 inches, but this is 1·5 inches
below the general average for a series of years, which is
24·52 inches. In the same year the average for the four
chief observing stations in the county was, however, 24·22
inches, with a maximum of 25·88 inches at New Barnet
and a minimum of 22·51 inches at Bennington. These
extremes were exceeded by a maximum of 28·29 inches
at Pendley Manor, Tring, and a minimum of 19·31 inches
(or rather more than 5 inches above the Essex minimum)
at Hillside, Buntingford.</p>

    <p class="caption">(<i>The figures show the annual rainfall in inches.</i>)</p>
  </div>

<p>For a succession of years it has, however, been observed
that the rainfall of Hertfordshire is in excess of that of
all the adjacent counties to the west and south. This is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
shown by the following comparative average rainfalls
for 1905; viz.: Bedfordshire (23 stations), 20·47 ins.;
Buckinghamshire (32 stations), 22·06 ins.; Middlesex,
exclusive of London (49 stations), 22·26 ins.; and
Hertfordshire (51 stations), 23·47 ins. Of the 104
stations exclusive of Hertfordshire, the combined mean
rainfall is 21·6 inches; Hertfordshire thus showing an
excess over the average rainfall in the adjoining counties
of nearly two inches in actual amount.</p>

<p>As a whole, and in spite of the excess over its neighbour
in the matter of rainfall, Hertford may be reckoned
among the relatively dry counties; its average in 1905
being nearly four inches below that for England generally
in the same year.</p>

<p>At Bennington there were recorded 1523 hours of
bright sunshine during the year, and 54 absolutely sunless
days. Throughout Great Britain as a whole there were
186 days in the same year on which a minimum of
0·005 inch of rain fell; all such days with that or a
greater quantity of rain being officially known as rain-days.
At Greenwich, where the total amount of rainfall was
23·024 inches, the rain-days numbered 161, and the
wettest month was June when 4·323 inches of rain
were registered. June was also the wettest month of
the year in Hertfordshire, but the amount of rain was
much less than at Greenwich, being only 3·46 inches.</p>

<p>As regards bright sunshine, the number of hours in
England as a whole amounted to 1535, while in Kent
the number reached 1667·8, and at Tunbridge Wells
1712·4 hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span></p>

<p>In respect to the number of wet days during the year
in question Hertfordshire therefore occupied a very creditable
position, although its record for sunshine was less
satisfactory.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="Section_9" id="Section_9"><span class="spaced">9. People</span></a>&mdash;Race, Dialect, Settlements, Population.</h2>

<p>Previous to the Roman occupation of Britain Hertfordshire
was inhabited by two British tribes,&mdash;the
Cattyeuchlani, whose capital appears to have been Verulam
or <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans, and the Trinobantes. To what
extent these original British inhabitants of the county
survived the Roman and Saxon invasions is unknown;
but it may be taken as certain that at an early date
Anglo-Saxon was the language spoken in this part of the
country. Forty years ago Anglo-Saxon idioms and words
still lingered among the labouring rural population in the
Harpenden district (and probably elsewhere), which have
apparently now disappeared completely. Instead of
<em>houses</em>, the Anglo-Saxon plural <em lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">housen</em> was, for instance,
always used by the old people; while when a log of
timber was cut the wrong way of the grain they would
say that it would be sure to <em>spalt</em> (equivalent to the
German <em lang="de" xml:lang="de">spalten</em>), instead of to split.</p>

<p>Of the Anglo-Saxon language there were originally
two chief dialects, a northern and a southern; but after
the Norman conquest the number of such dialects was
increased to half-a-dozen. According to Dr A. J. Elli<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>s’s
<cite>English Dialects</cite>, southern Hertfordshire comes within
the domain of the south-eastern dialect, which also prevailed
in Middlesex, south-eastern Buckinghamshire, and
south-western Essex. Throughout this area there is,
however, an underlying basis of the middle eastern dialect,
which is still to be detected in northern Hertfordshire,
as well as in Essex, Bedfordshire, Huntingdonshire, and
Northamptonshire. It accordingly appears that if the East
Anglian counties of Cambridgeshire, Suffolk, and Norfolk
be eliminated, the whole of the country lying to the eastward
of the Chiltern Hills, as well as the high grounds of
Northamptonshire, had one dialect in common, which
was the speech of the early Teuton settlers of this part of
England. This dialect, during the course of fourteen
centuries, has been gradually modified and altered by the
speech of London till it has resulted in the modern
English of this part of south-eastern England.</p>

<p>According to Mr R. A. Smith, writing in the <cite>Victoria
History of the Counties of England</cite>, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>“The grouping of
dialects in this part of the country would thus unite
Hertfordshire with Essex, and lead us to expect from
archæology some indications of Saxon rather than of
Anglian influence in the county. The few results
already obtained in Hertfordshire certainly show a marked
absence of Anglian characteristics, but many discoveries
must be made before the peculiarities of East Saxon
remains can be demonstrated. To the west of the
Chilterns enough has been recovered from graves to
show that the settlers in the upper Thames valley, presumably
the Saxons of the West, were homogeneous
[uniform in characteristics] and distinguishable from their
neighbours; but at present nothing has been found to link
them with the people of Essex, who probably reached the
eastern slopes of the Chilterns at one time, but were
mainly confined to the north of Essex and the neighbourhood
of London. In fact, the few discoveries in this
district point rather to a connection with Kent [the
country of the British tribe of Cantii] than with Wessex.”</p>

<p>Whatever may be the precise state of the case with
regard to these details, it may be taken as certain that the
present population of Hertfordshire is mainly descended
from the Saxons who came to Britain in the fifth and
sixth centuries. There must have been, however, a
certain mixture of ancient British blood; while later, and
more especially among the higher classes, this was followed
by the infusion of a Norman strain. Otherwise the population
of the county does not appear to have been much
influenced by foreign immigration, although there was a
settlement of Huguenots in <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans, who have left
their mark in the name of one of the streets&mdash;French
Row&mdash;near the market-place.</p>

    <p class="caption">French Row, <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans</p>
  </div>

<p>Passing on to the present day, we have the somewhat
curious anomaly that the population of the administrative
county is somewhat larger than that of the original
county; this being due to the inclusion in the former of
some thickly populated areas. The population of the
administrative county in the census of 1901 was given as
258,423; ten years previously it was 226,587, thus showing
a very marked increase; that of the ancient county
was 250,152 persons. The number of persons to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
square mile in Hertfordshire, on the latter basis at the
former date, was thus about 398, against 558 for
England and Wales generally. During the last twenty-five
years the increase of the population has mainly
taken place on the three great lines of railways, the
Great Northern, the Midland, and the North-Western,
at such places as Barnet, Hitchin, <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans, Harpenden,
and Watford. <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans has indeed altogether outstripped
the county town in point of numbers; its population
being 16,019 in 1901 against the 9,322 of Hertford.
In common with England generally, there has of late years
been a marked tendency for the rural population to
migrate to the larger villages and towns; and this dominance
of the urban population has been accentuated by the
transference to <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans and elsewhere of large manufacturing
and printing establishments from the metropolis.
The urban districts on the lines of railway likewise constitute
the residence of a large population of men having
daily business in London.</p>

<p>As in the country generally, the females in 1901
largely exceeded the male population in numbers; the
total for the former being 18,176, and for the latter
16,723. The great majority of these lived in houses, of
which 54,963 were inhabited at the date in question. In
addition to these, 71 were living in military barracks;
something like another 5,200 were maintained in workhouses,
hospitals, asylums, industrial schools, etc., while
barges on the canals accounted for about another 147. It
should be added that the county contains several large
London asylums; it would therefore give a very exag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>gerated
proportion, as compared with the true state of
the case, if the number of lunatics resident in the county
were quoted.</p>

<p>As already mentioned, the greater portion of Hertfordshire,
that is to say, most of the chalk area, exclusive
of the downs, commons, woods, and private parks, was in
former years devoted to corn, for the cultivation of which
its soil is particularly well suited. Indeed the county had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
the reputation of growing not only the best barley for
malting, but likewise the best wheat-straw (that is to say,
the hardest and whitest) for plaiting. The wheat itself
was also of specially good quality and hardness, and there
was likewise an abundance of mills in which it could be
converted into flour. A noteworthy feature of Hertfordshire
agriculture is the practice of mixing chalk with the
soils, especially where they are clayey; this resulting in a
decided increase in fertility.</p>

<p>A century and a half ago wheat, barley, and oats
formed the chief cereal crops; beans being better suited
to the Vale of Aylesbury, while peas are profitable only
on the very light chalky grounds. Clover, lucerne, trefoil,
turnips, and (in later times) swedes and mangold are also
extensively grown. In this connection it is interesting to
note that the first crops of red clover and of swede turnips
ever grown in this country were sown at Broadby Farm,
near Berkhampstead; a spot celebrated in literature as
having been the home of Peter the Wild Boy in 1725. A
certain amount of grass land was intermingled with that
under cereal and root cultivation; while, as mentioned in
earlier sections, most of the heavy land in the south and
south-east of the county is under grass.</p>

<p>“Hertfordshire farming,” observes a recent writer,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>“has undergone little material change since Ellis’s
description of it in 1732; the hay-crop has become a
more prominent feature perhaps, potatoes on the lighter
soils have gained a leading place in the rotation, and the
standard of fertility has been raised all round; otherwise
a farm on the high chalk-plateau was farmed in 1732
pretty much on the same lines as it is to-day. Ellis gives
a list of the chief weeds, ‘crow-garlick, wild oat, carlock,
poppy, mayweed, bindweed, dock, crow-needle, black
bent’: they are not less troublesome nor any nearer
extinction at the present time, the last grass in particular
being very characteristic of corn-land on the ‘clay with
flints’.”</p>

<p>Every year the Board of Agriculture publishes a
return in which the number of acres in each county
devoted to each particular kind of crop is duly recorded,
the classification adopted being as follows, viz.: corn
crops; green crops; clover, sainfoin, and grasses for hay;
grass not for hay; flax; hops; small fruits; and orchards.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
Such land as produces none of these crops is classed as
bare fallow, of which Hertfordshire in 1905 possessed
14,275 acres.</p>

<p>Of the total of 402,856<a name="Anchor_2" id="Anchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2.">[2]</a> acres in the county, 329,641
were under cultivation in that year; 1917 were orchards,
26,568 were woodland, while 1657 acres consisted of
heaths and commons used as grazing-grounds. At the
same date there were 116,700 acres under corn-cultivation;
that is to say, something approaching one-fourth
the total acreage, against about one-seventh in Kent.
Green crops accounted for 32,702 acres, while of the
remainder there were 36,831 under clover, sainfoin, and
grasses, 3315 under lucerne, meadows claimed 54,589
acres, pasture 70,678, and small fruits 544. Of the corn-grazing
area, wheat occupied 51,691, oats 36,946, and
barley 27,960 acres.</p>

</div>

<p>It is thus apparent that out of the 329,641 acres of
cultivated land no less than 200,000, or more than half
the whole area of the county, and about 60 per cent. of the
total farming land, was still under the plough; this large
proportion being at the time exceeded only in six English
counties. The increase in permanent pasture has, however,
been steadily progressing since the great fall in the
price of cereals in the seventies; this being aided by the
improvements in the means of communication throughout
the country, which have tended to rob Hertfordshire of its
original special advantage (owing to its proximity) in the
matter of supplying the metropolis with corn and straw.</p>

<p>The subject of Hertfordshire agriculture cannot be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
dismissed without mention of the fact that the world-renowned
agricultural station at Rothamsted, in Harpenden
parish, founded and endowed by the late Sir J. B.
Lawes, is included within its limits. This includes a
laboratory, under a Director, situated on the west side
of Harpenden common, and certain plots of land in the
park at Rothamsted where agricultural experiments have
been carried on for more than sixty years. The whole
station is administered by a committee, mainly appointed
by the Royal Society.</p>

<p>Fruit is grown only to a comparatively small extent
in Hertfordshire. Very characteristic of the county are,
however, the orchards (now for the most part more or less
neglected) of small black cherries, known as Hertfordshire
blacks, and also as “mazzards,” which are situated near
the homesteads of most of the older farms. These are
probably a cultivated variety of the wild black cherry of
the neighbouring woods.</p>

<p>On the rich-soiled, low-lying lands of the Lea valley
on the south-eastern side of the county are situated
numerous market-gardens and nurseries. The growing
of tomatos (at Harpenden), cucumbers, and grapes under
glass is carried on in several parts of the county on a more
or less extensive scale.</p>

<p>Elm, oak, beech, and ash form the most common
timber-trees of the county, but the predominance of each
kind in particular districts depends, as already mentioned,
on the nature of the geological formation. The undergrowth
in the woods, which should be cut every 12 or 13
years, consists mainly of hazel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span></p>

<p>As regards the number of the larger and commoner
kinds of domesticated animals, sheep in 1905 reached a
total of 94,461, or about 234 to every 1000 acres; the
average for England generally being 445 per 1000 acres.
The prevailing breeds are the Hampshire Down, the
South Down, and the Dorset; the latter being favoured
on account of their early lambing.</p>

<p>Hertfordshire is not a great horse-breeding county, and
in 1905 the number of these animals was only 15,070.
Cattle numbered 38,636, and pigs 25,338. Shorthorns
are the favourite breed of cattle among the farmers; and
although in the chalk districts the soil is not specially well
suited for dairy purposes, farms near the main railways
despatch a considerable amount of milk to London. The
number of horses was nearly the same as in 1901, but
cattle showed an increase of nearly 2000 head. Sheep,
however, had decreased by over 2000 and pigs by more
than 6000.</p>

<h2><a name="Section_11" id="Section_11"><span class="spaced">11. Special</span></a> Cultivations.</h2>

<p>The most important special cultivation in Hertfordshire
is undoubtedly watercress, which is very extensively
grown in the river-valleys over a broad belt of country
extending from the Welwyn district, through the parishes
of Harpenden, Wheathampstead and Redbourn, and
thence to Amersham and Rickmansworth, as well as to
the Vale of Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire; this district
being reported to be the best in England for this particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
crop. The cress is grown in beds cut through the low-ground
from one bend of the river to another, so that
a constant, but regulated stream of water is continually
flowing through. The seed is sown in special beds, and
the young cress carefully planted out in regular rows in
the mud of the permanent beds during the autumn.
Much care has to be exercised in tending and weeding
the crop, from which two prolonged cuttings are obtained
annually; the spring cutting being, however, much larger
and better than the autumn one.</p>

<p>After cutting, the watercress is tied up in bundles and
packed in flat, oblong, osier hampers, or baskets; of which,
during the spring season, huge stacks may be seen at the
local railway stations awaiting despatch, either to the
metropolis, or to the great manufacturing towns of the
Midlands. For ordinary purposes the land on which
watercress is grown is almost valueless; but the watercress
beds yield a big rental. To furnish material for the
aforesaid watercress hampers, as well as for basket-work
generally, osiers are cultivated in some of the river-valleys,
as in the Lea a mile or so above Wheathampstead, where
there are extensive beds.</p>

<p>Next in importance to the cultivation of watercress
in the Harpenden-Redbourn district is that of lavender at
Hitchin, where numerous fields on a spur of the chalk
range near Windmill Hill are devoted to the growth of
this fragrant plant. In late summer or early autumn
the terminal spikes of blossom are nipped from their long
stems, and garnered for the sake of their contained oil,
which is distilled into lavender-water in Hitchin itself.
Lavender-water has been produced at Hitchin for a period
of fully eighty years. The growing of lavender as an
industry is extremely restricted in England.</p>

<h2><a name="Section_12" id="Section_12"><span class="spaced">12. Industries</span></a> and Manufactures.</h2>

<p>As will be inferred from the statements in earlier
chapters with regard to its essentially agricultural nature,
Hertfordshire is in no wise a manufacturing county like
Lancashire or Yorkshire; this being due, no doubt, in
great part to the fact that it possesses no commercially
valuable minerals of its own, or, at all events, none which
are at present accessible to the miner.</p>

<p>During the last quarter of a century or so a certain
number of manufacturing and industrial establishments
have been moved from London and set up in various
parts of the county, as at <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans and elsewhere; but
these cannot be termed Hertfordshire industries in the
proper sense of the term, and do not need further mention.</p>

<p>One of the great industries of the county is the malting
business carried on at Ware, as is indicated by the number
of cowls over the drying-kilns, which form conspicuous
objects for miles round. Ware was the greatest malting
place in England. The method of malting is too well
known and the industry too widely spread to call for any
special notes on the subject.</p>

<p>In former years, say up to about 1865, the straw-plait
industry afforded employment to a whole army of workers
in north-western Herts and the neighbouring districts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire; and at that date the
women and children might be seen in summer plaiting
the straw at almost every cottage-door in each village or
town. As already mentioned, the chalk districts of the
county grow wheat-straw specially well suited for plait.
The straws to be used were selected and pulled one by
one from the sheaves before the latter were threshed;
and, after having the corn-ears cut off, were done up into
bundles. The latter were in turn cut into such lengths
as could be obtained free from knots, and tied up into
smaller bundles ready for sale to the workers. Before
being employed in plaiting, each straw was split longitudinally
into several strips by means of a brass instrument,
which consisted of a handle and a pointed, star-shaped
head bent down at right angles to the former. The
finished plait was sold at so much per “score” (that is to
say twenty yards) for manufacture into hats and bonnets.
Cheap Chinese labour has completely killed the local
plaiting industry; but the manufacture of the finished
foreign plait into hats still constitutes an important trade
in <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans and elsewhere, as well as at Luton and
Dunstable in Bedfordshire; the sewing of the plait
into hats being done mainly, if not entirely, in large
factories. Tring was a great plait centre.</p>

<p>The manufacture of textile fabrics was formerly carried
on in several parts of the county, but in most of these has
either completely ceased or fallen into decline. About
1802 there were mills for the manufacture both of silk
and cloth at Rickmansworth; and the occurrence of
the name “Fuller Street” in the records of <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
apparently indicates the existence at some unknown date
of the latter industry in that city, and there were certainly
cotton-mills at Sopwell, to the south of it. The Abbey
silk-mills, on the Ver, are still working at <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans,
although with a much diminished output; but those at
the neighbouring village of Redbourn have been recently
closed. Tring had silk-mills, and canvas was also made
there. Lace-making was probably carried on by some
of the cottagers on the Buckinghamshire side of the
county, where it flourishes to a certain extent at the
present day, and may even still here and there survive.</p>

    <p class="caption">Moor Park, near Rickmansworth</p>
  </div>

<p>Nowadays perhaps the most important manufacturing
industry in the county is that carried on at the paper-mills
at Abbot’s Langley, where a large amount of high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
class paper is turned out. Being on the canal, these mills
have the advantage of water-carriage. Paper, it may be
observed, is made nowadays from wood-pulp and esparto
grass, as well as from linen rags.</p>

    <p class="caption">Canal and Lock, Rickmansworth</p>
  </div>

<p>Brick-making employs a considerable number of hands
in various parts of the county; the glacial and other
superficial deposits on the chalk area frequently yielding
excellent brick-earth; while the London clay may be
employed for brick-making anywhere in the south-eastern
districts. Bricks from the London clay, which is naturally
blue, turn yellow or white after burning in consequence
of the combustion of the organic colouring matter; but
many of those from the glacial clays are of a full rich red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
At Pepperstock, near Caddington, however, there are
manufactured certain very hard, heather-coloured bricks,
which are much favoured for house-building in north-western
Hertfordshire, although their colour compares
very unfavourably in the matter of effect when contrasted
with the “brick-red” of the more ordinary kinds.</p>

<p>As we approach the Gault plain of Bedfordshire
numerous cement works may be seen at the edge of the
chalk-marl near the northern borders of the county, some
of which may be within the county itself. Chalk is
much worked, as at Hitchin and elsewhere, for lime;
and, as already mentioned, is dug largely by the farmers
for “chalking” their fields. It is to such diggings that
the deep circular pits (now generally ploughed over) to be
seen in many arable fields are due. The Totternhoe stone
has been, and perhaps still is, quarried locally for building
in some parts of the northern districts of the county.</p>

</div>
<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="Section_13" id="Section_13"><span class="spaced">13. Minerals</span></a>&mdash;An Exhausted Industry.</h2>

<p>Having referred in the <a href="#Section_12" title="Go to section 12.">last section</a> to brick-making,
lime, cement, and Totternhoe stone, very little remains
for mention in the present one; as the absence of mines
is one of the features of Hertfordshire and the adjacent
counties.</p>

<p>Reference may, however, again be made to the so-called
coprolite beds of the chalk-marl which were worked
in the neighbourhood of Hitchin in the early part of the
first half of last century as a source of phosphoric acid for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
agricultural manure. The irregularly shaped black nodules
of phosphate of lime occur crowded together in a comparatively
thin bed. They were dug out, and washed
from the marl in which they were embedded on the spot
in large circular tanks through which a wheel was made
to revolve by horse-labour; and then carted away to be
converted by a chemical process into superphosphate.
After the excavation of the coprolite bed from one strip
of a field, the marl from the next was thrown in, and the
top soil replaced, so that the land was left in as good, or
even better, condition than previously. The industry
was continued till all the beds situated at or above a level
which it paid to work were exhausted.</p>

<p>In winter there is a considerable local trade in gravel
and shingle, dug mainly in the valleys. Twenty years
ago this trade was much more extensive in some districts
than is at present the case; this being due partly to the
exhaustion of the deposits, partly to the fact that in districts
served by the Midland Railway the use of syenite from
Mount Sorrel and Charnwood Forest, in Leicestershire,
has to a considerable extent replaced flint-gravel as road-metal
on the main highways of the county and in the
metropolitan districts. Formerly, very large quantities
of gravel were sent from <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans and Harpenden to the
northern metropolitan suburbs such as Hendon and Child’s
Hill; but most of that now dug is employed for road-metal
on the local by-roads. Here it should be mentioned
that in Hertfordshire phraseology the term “gravel” is
used exclusively to denote the coarse big-stoned material
used as road-metal; what is ordinarily denoted as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
“gravel”&mdash;that is to say the material employed for
garden-paths&mdash;being locally known as “hoggin.” Flints
picked from the fields of the chalk area have a higher
value as road-metal than dug gravel, owing to their
superior hardness; the so-called “quarry-water,” which
is present in all dug gravel, having been long since dried
out.</p>

<p>“Facing” flints for building purposes is an art much
less commonly practised in the county than was the case
in earlier days; and when buildings of faced flint are
contemplated it is generally necessary to send to a distance
in order to secure the services of an expert in the facing
process.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="Section_14" id="Section_14"><span class="spaced">14. History</span></a> of Hertfordshire.</h2>

<p>The history of Hertfordshire includes such a number
of events of primary importance that it is somewhat
difficult to make a selection of those most fitted to appear
in the limited space available. It was in this county that
the offer of the crown of England was made to William
the Conqueror, and it was from here that the first petition
for the redress of grievances was forwarded to Charles <abbr title="the First">I</abbr>;
while several important battles have been fought within
its limits.</p>

<p>To the two British tribes who inhabited this part of
England previous to the Roman invasion, reference has
been made in an earlier section. The first landing of
Julius Caesar took place (in Kent) in 55 <span class="allcap">B.C.</span>, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
second and more successful in 54 <span class="allcap">B.C.</span>; while a third
Roman invasion took place under Claudius in 43 <span class="allcap">A.D.</span>,
from which date the Roman legions held possession of the
whole country till about the year 410 <span class="allcap">A.D.</span> Whether
Caesar himself ever visited Verulam does not appear to be
definitely ascertained, but it was early in the history of
that great city that the encounter between the British
Queen Boadicea and the Romans took place. During
the Roman period Hertfordshire, which then appears to
have been a well-populated and wealthy district, formed
a part of the province of Flavia Caesariensis.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <img width="550" height="343" src="images/i_077.jpg" alt="The Monastery Gateway, St Albans" id="i_077" />
    <p class="caption">The Monastery Gateway, <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans</p>
  </div>

<p>The next great event was the Saxon Conquest, which
in Kent was ushered in by the landing of a force in the
year 449 <span class="allcap">A.D.</span> During this part of its history the western,
or larger portion of our county was included, as already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
mentioned, in the kingdom of Mercia, while the eastern
and smaller section belonged to that of Essex. Of the
numerous Mercian kings, the most renowned and most
powerful was Offa, whose name survives in Offley, where
he had a palace, and where he died about the year 796,
while still engaged in building the Monastery and Abbey
of <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Alban. Mercia at this time made a bid for the
supremacy of the petty kingdoms of this part of England,
but was eventually beaten by Wessex under the able rule
of Egbert.</p>

<p>It was in the reign of the last-mentioned sovereign
that invaders of another nationality&mdash;namely the Danes&mdash;began
to make their presence seriously felt in the south;
but it was not till the time of his son and successor
Aethelwulf that they landed on the east coast. Early in
his reign a council of Mercians and West Saxons was held
at Kingsbury, near <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans, to devise means for repelling
the invaders; while a second assembly was called for the
same purpose at Bennington in the year 850. Neither
seems to have resulted in effectual measures, for in 851
we find a large Danish fleet which had sailed up the
Thames beating off one of the Saxon kings, who had
marched to stop its progress; and after this event the
county was harried and raided time after time, till it
was eventually divided about the year 880 by a treaty
executed at Wedmore between the Saxon sovereign
Alfred and Guthrum the Dane by a boundary line
running from the mouth of the Lea to its source, and
thence straight across country to Bedford. A few years
later, however, namely in 894, the Danish fleet sailed up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
the Lea to Hertford, where Alfred crippled it by cutting
into the banks of the river, so that by loss of water the
vessels became stranded, and the Danish force had to fight
its way to the west of England. After numerous skirmishes
and fights, and the building of forts at Hertford
and on a small island near Bishop’s Stortford, the Danish
invasion was practically crushed by King Edward, who
died in 925. Much, however, still remained to be done
by his son Aethelstan, who stoutly attacked the invaders
after they had made a raid on <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans in 930. A
memorial of the Danish sojourn still exists in Dacorum,
the name of the western hundred in which Tring is
situated; there is also evidence to the same effect in the
records of gifts to <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans Abbey by Danes who had
settled in the neighbourhood. The Mercian shire-system,
which was probably instituted as an aid against the Danes,
is known to have come into force by 957; but in place of
Hertfordshire having a sheriff of its own, it shared one
with Essex; an arrangement which remained in force till
the reign of Elizabeth. This was in Edgar’s reign
(957–975); but even then we do not reach the end
of the Danish trouble, which did not cease till after
Sweyn’s invasions between the years 1011 and 1014,
which were worse than their predecessors, and included
the pillage of Canterbury. About this time occurs the
first mention of “Heorotford” as the name of the county.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the country recovered, in greater or less
degree, from the Danish raids than it was conquered by
the Normans under William <abbr title="the First">I</abbr>, who soon after the battle
of Hastings marched through the country south of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
Thames till he reached Berkhampstead in this county,
where he built the castle whose foundations and earthworks
remain to this day. By relentless severity against
all who stood in his way on the march, William had succeeded
in instilling a wholesome fear into the Saxon (or,
as we now say, English) inhabitants of the country; and,
although he is reported to have been successfully opposed
by Frederic, Abbot of <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans, he was finally tendered
the submission of the people and the English crown at
Berkhampstead.</p>

<p>To follow in detail the events of the troublous times
which succeeded the conquest is here impossible; and it
must suffice to state that at Christmas, 1116, Henry <abbr title="the First">I</abbr> paid
a visit to <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans for the purpose apparently of quelling
trouble among the turbulent Norman barons who had
now become the paramount lords. Stephen also held a
court at <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans in 1143 in connection with other
troubles. With the bare mention that several Hertfordshire
barons accompanied Richard <abbr title="the First">I</abbr> in his crusade to the
Holy Land, we may pass on to the quarrel between
King John and his barons, which has a very intimate
connection with our county; among the opposing noblemen
being Robert Fitzwalter, their leader, and the Earls
of Essex and of Hertford. The barons advanced from
Northampton to Bedford, while the main body of their
army marched to Ware and thence to London. The
signing of Magna Charta produced temporary peace; but
this was soon succeeded by fiercer fighting than ever in
this county. At the commencement of 1215 John himself
was in <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans, and also had possession of Hertford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
and Berkhampstead castles. In May of the same year
Louis landed from France, and in due course besieged
Hertford and Berkhampstead till they surrendered, and
then proceeded to <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans, where he was for some
time defied by the abbot. At the departure of Louis the
castles were restored to the king.</p>

<p>The next event is the looting of <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans by
Fulke de Breauté and his band in 1217.</p>

<p>The trouble with the barons continued into the reign
of Henry <abbr title="the Third">III</abbr>; and in the year 1261 the autumn parliament
was held at <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans. Up to 1295 the shires alone sent
representatives to parliament but in the session held at
<abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans in that year the cities, boroughs, and chief
towns were each permitted to elect two parliamentary
burgesses. During the reign of Edward <abbr title="the Second">II</abbr> the county
was considerably involved in the affairs of Sir Piers de
Gaveston, who spent much of his time at King’s Langley,
where Edward had a palace, and where Gaveston was
buried after his execution in 1312. During that year the
papal envoy met the barons at <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans with a view to
the settlement of their differences with the king; and in
July, 1321, the barons marched through that city on their
way to London. During the fourteenth century the
county suffered severely from plague; but in spite of this
Edward <abbr title="the Third">III</abbr> spent much time at Langley; and in 1361
the king and queen came to Berkhampstead to take leave
of the Black Prince (to whom the castle had been given)
previous to his departure for Aquitaine.</p>

<p>In 1381, owing to exactions on the part of the king
and the abbot of <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans, there broke out the peasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>s’
revolt, in which Hertfordshire men took a large share.
Indeed after the execution of Wat Tyler the king proposed
to go himself to <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans to punish the insurgents,
but was persuaded to send a commission in his stead;
although a short time later, after another riot, his majesty
appeared in person in that city at the head of an armed
force.</p>

<p>With the bare mention that in the second year of his
reign King Henry <abbr title="the Fourth">IV</abbr> visited the abbey, we pass on to
the Wars of the Roses, and especially the first battle of
<abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans, which was fought in May, 1455. The
Lancastrians, or royalists, held the main street of the city
till the Yorkists, under the leadership of the Duke of
Warwick, burst through the defences from the direction
of Sopwell and cut the royalist position in half. In less
than an hour they had the city in their own hands, after
a great carnage, during which King Henry <abbr title="the Sixth">VI</abbr> himself
was wounded. In 1458 the king visited Berkhampstead
with the object of quelling the strife, but to no purpose;
and in February, 1461, the two factions again fought an
engagement at <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans, this time at Bernard’s Heath,
to the northward of <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Peter’s Church. This second
battle of <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans ended in a victory for the king. On
14th April, 1471, Edward defeated Warwick in the great
battle of Barnet, on the south-east border of the county.</p>

<p>Hertfordshire had much to do with royalty during the
reign of King Henry <abbr title="the Eight">VIII</abbr>, the palace at King’s Langley
being bestowed on Queen Catherine, while the king
himself spent much time at Hunsdon House, and also had
a residence at Tittenhanger. There is, moreover, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
tradition that he was married to Anne Boleyn at Sopwell.
The Princess Mary lived for a time at Hertford Castle
previous to her removal to Hunsdon, where Princess
Elizabeth also lived before her long sojourn at Hatfield,
in which beautiful park she was informed of her accession
to the throne. When queen, Elizabeth continued to be
a frequent visitor to the county; and in her reign, owing
to plague in London, the law courts were held for a time
at <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans, while, for the same reason, Parliament sat
at Hertford in 1564 and 1581. The sovereign herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
came as a guest to Lord Burleigh at Theobalds, to the
Earl of Essex at Cassiobury, and to Sir Nicholas Bacon at
Gorhambury. James <abbr title="the First">I</abbr> likewise spent much time in the
county, having an establishment at Royston, and dying at
Theobalds. During the civil wars Hertfordshire men
played an important part in connection with what was
known as the Eastern Association; and in 1643, when
the High Sheriff ventured to read a royal proclamation
in the market-place at <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans, he was arrested by
Cromwell himself. To follow the fortunes of Hertfordshire
during the conflict between Charles <abbr title="the First">I</abbr> and Parliament
would occupy too much space; and it must suffice to
mention that in 1660 Sir Harbottle Grimston of Gorhambury
was Speaker of the House of Commons and took a
leading part in the restoration of King Charles <abbr title="the Second">II</abbr>.</p>

<p>The last event in the history of the county to which
space admits allusion is the Rye House Plot. “In the
spring of 1683,” to quote the words of a well-known
local writer, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>“Charles <abbr title="the Second">II</abbr> and James Duke of York went
to see the races at Newmarket. Just opposite to the
Rye House Inn there stood then a castle, built in the
days of Henry <abbr title="the Sixth">VI</abbr>, and in that castle lived one Rumbold,
formerly an officer in the parliamentary army. Rumbold
and about a score of equally reckless malcontents put their
heads together over their tankards, and, so far as can be
gathered from many rather contradictory narratives, they
formed a plot to delay the royal party on the return
journey from Newmarket to London, by placing an
overturned cart in the road-way, in order that they
might shoot the King and the Duke of York in the
confusion. The conspiracy was frustrated, for the royal
party returned earlier than Rumbold had been led to
expect, and presently the plot leaked out. The Rye
House was searched, incriminating papers were discovered,
and the affair culminated in the arrest of those nobler
patriots who, in concert with Argyle, had been planning
the overthrow of what they honestly regarded as a corrupt
government.”</p>

<h2><a name="Section_15" id="Section_15"><span class="spaced">15. Antiquities</span></a>&mdash;Prehistoric, Roman, Saxon.</h2>

<p>The earliest evidence of the presence of man in
Hertfordshire is afforded, as elsewhere in this country,
not by written or sculptured records, but by stone implements
of various shapes and types. The very earliest of
these implements, at any rate, belong to a time when the
mammoth inhabited this country, which was then united
to the continent; and their age must be reckoned by
thousands, if not by tens of thousands, of years. The
period to which all these implements belong, being before
all human records, is known as the Prehistoric; and it is
important to mention that this term should be restricted
to the epoch intervening between the time of the formation
of the uppermost portion of the Tertiary beds and
the first dawn of history. We often find the term
“prehistoric monsters” applied to the great reptiles of
the Chalk and Oolites; but such a usage, although
etymologically justifiable, is technically wrong.</p>

<p>The Prehistoric period for lack of all other means of
dating has been divided by antiquarians, according to the
material of which man formed his implements, into the
Stone, the Bronze, and the late-Celtic or Iron Ages; the
Stone age being further divided into an older, or Palaeolithic,
section, in which all the so-called “celts,” or flint implements,
were formed simply by chipping, and a newer
Neolithic section, in which they were often ground and
polished. In connection with these implements attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
may be directed to some of the ancient earthworks in the
county, although the age of many of these is unknown,
and in some cases may be later than the Roman occupation.
The antiquities newer than the late-Celtic age are
described as referable to the Roman or the Saxon period,
as the case may be. These correspond with the history
of England from 55 <span class="allcap">B.C.</span> to 1066 <span class="allcap">A.D.</span></p>

<p>Palaeolithic implements are found locally in certain
parts of the county, although from the gravels of a very
considerable area, especially the Harpenden district, they
appear to be absent. The larger implements, or “celts,”
which are often six or seven inches in length, seem to
have been employed for all purposes, and to have been
held in the hand, without handle or shaft, although some
of them might easily be used as spear-heads. The first
discovery of an implement of this type in the county was
made near Bedmond, Abbot’s Langley, in 1861. A few
specimens have been obtained in other parts of the Colne
basin; but in the district round Kensworth and Caddington
vast numbers have been discovered, although for the
most part just outside the county boundary. In fact, near
Caddington the Stone-age men had a great manufactory
of these implements:&mdash;a kind of Palaeolithic Sheffield.
In the basin of the Lea a few flakes, etc., have been found
at or near Ayot <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Peter, Welwyn, Hertford, Bengeo,
Ware, Amwell, Hoddesdon, Ippolits, Stocking Pelham,
and elsewhere. Much more important is a “find” at
Hitchin, near the source of the Hiz, and thus situated, in
part at any rate, in the Ouse basin. These implements,
which were first brought to notice in 1877, occur in clay-pits
worked for brick-earth, and are accompanied by bones
of the mammoth, hippopotamus, and rhinoceros.</p>

  </div>

<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></p>

<p>Between the Palaeolithic and Neolithic age exists a
gap of untold length, for the land had again to be
re-peopled. Chipped, or rough-hewn celts, or hatchets,
of the latter age have been picked up in fields near Abbot’s
Langley, Bedmond, Kensworth, Wheathampstead, Markyate
Street, and Weston. Polished celts are more rare,
but specimens have been found at Panshanger, King’s
Langley, Aldbury (near Stortford), Ashwell, and between
Hitchin and Pirton. Perforated axe-heads and hammer-heads
of stone, which may belong to the close of the
Neolithic or commencement of the Bronze age, are still
more uncommon, although a few such have been found,
notably a hammer, near Sandridge, now preserved in the
British Museum. Much the same remark applies to
chipped arrow-heads&mdash;the fairy darts of a more poetical
age&mdash;but a few beautiful specimens have been found near
Tring, some so long ago as the year 1763 or thereabouts,
and others at Ashwell and Hunsdon.</p>

<p>After a time man learnt the use of metal. The
smelting of iron was at first beyond his power, and he
employed the mixture of copper and tin which we term
bronze. Of this age specimens of winged celts and
palstaves (a narrow hatchet, with a tang or socket for a
haft) have been found in various parts of the county, as
well as socketed celts, daggers, swords, spear-heads, and
the like. The most important discovery of this nature
was made in 1876 during drainage operations at Cumberlow
Green, near Baldock, when some forty bronze imple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>ments
were found in a well-like hole. Gold ornaments,
probably referable to the same epoch, have been found at
Little Amwell and at Mardox, near Ware.</p>

<p>We now come to the early Iron Age, when man had
succeeded in mastering this metal. Of this a very brief
notice must suffice. Primitive coins, without inscription,
of the type issued by Philip <abbr title="the Second">II</abbr> of Macedon, and hence
known as Philippi, were probably coined in the county in
early British times; but after the Roman invasion a
number of British coins were struck at Verulamium,
among the most interesting of which are those of Tarciovanus,
who reigned in that city from (probably) about
30 <span class="allcap">B.C.</span> to about 5 <span class="allcap">A.D.</span> A large number of his coins
have been found at Verulam, as well as those of other
British sovereigns. Tarciovanus, it may be added, was
the father of Cunovelinus (Shakespeare’s Cymbeline),
whose capital was Camulodunum, the modern Colchester.</p>

    <p class="caption">The Devil’s Dyke, Marford</p>
  </div>

<p>Earthworks of great but unknown antiquity are by
no means uncommon in Hertfordshire; one of the most
important being Grimes-ditch, or Grimm’s Dyke, traces
of which remain on Berkhampstead common, as well as
on the opposite side of the Bulbourne valley, while a deep
ditch runs in a bold sweep from near Great Berkhampstead
through Northchurch and Wiggington to the north of
Cholesbury camp, and thence into Buckinghamshire.
Beech Bottom forms another great dyke lying between
the site of Verulam and Sandridge, and is probably pre-Roman,
and possibly connected with the encampment
east of Wheathampstead known as the Moats or the Slad.
The latter forms part of a great system of earthworks of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
which the opposite side is marked by the Devil’s Dyke at
Marford. The great earthworks running outside of and
parallel to parts of the Roman wall at Verulam are likewise
older than the latter. Berkhampstead Castle may
stand on the site of an earlier camp, as British and Roman
coins have been found there; but the mound or keep, as
at Bishop’s Stortford, Pirton, and Hertford Castles, is
probably Saxon. On the other hand, the well-preserved
camp near Redbourn, known as the Aubreys, Auberys, or
Aubury, is certainly pre-Roman; and the same is probably
the case with some of the numerous other earthworks
dotted over the county, such as Arbury Banks, Ashwell.
A few barrows or tombs of pre-Roman age have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
opened and examined in various parts of the county, as at
Therfield, Royston, and Easneye near Ware.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">

  </div>

<p>In evidence of the Roman occupation of Britain
Hertfordshire is unusually rich, although limitations of
space prevent anything like justice being done to this part
of the subject. The county is, in the first place, traversed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
from south to north by three main Roman roads, the
Watling Street, running through <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans and Markyate,
the Ermine Street, passing through Hertford, and the
Icknield Way, traversing Hatfield and Baldock; as well
as by the Roman Way, connecting the latter town with
Hertford. Of these we shall speak presently. The
crowning Roman glory of Hertfordshire is, however,
the city of Verulamium, or Verulam, situated on the hill
on the opposite side of the Ver to <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans. Much of
the foundations of this city lie buried within the area
partially enclosed by the remains of the massive walls;
and the ploughman within that ring is constantly turning
up coins, fragments of pottery and glass, and other articles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span></p>

    <p class="caption">Roman Wall in <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Germans’ Meadow, Verulam</p>
  </div>

<p class="noindent">In one place are buried the apparently complete foundations
of an amphitheatre, which was opened out many
years ago, but again covered up after examination. Of
the walls considerable portions, in a more or less damaged
condition, still remain to bear eloquent testimony to the
lasting character of Roman masonry; and much more
would have persisted had they not been used as a
convenient source of materials for the construction of
<abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans’ Abbey and other ancient buildings. The
basement of a Roman villa, in a fine state of preservation,
was opened out at Sarratt Bottom in 1908, and plans of
the structure prepared, after which the excavations were
filled in. Other Roman remains are known to exist in
the district.</p>

    <p class="caption"><abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans’ Abbey from the South Side</p>
  </div>

<p>Ravensburgh Castle, Hexton, is a well-known Roman
camp, built on an earlier foundation; and remains of
Roman camps exist at Braughing and several other places
in the county, although in many cases the precise age of
such ancient stations does not appear to be definitely
ascertained.</p>

<p>Isolated Roman remains of various kinds occur in
many parts of Hertfordshire. From the writer’s own
neighbourhood the British Museum possesses a Roman
altar found many years ago at Harpenden, as well as a
Romano-British stone coffin, containing a glass vessel and
pottery, found near Pickford Mill in the Lea valley, east
of Harpenden, in 1827. The remains of another Roman
interment, including fine specimens of amphorae, or large
two-handled pottery vessels, were found about the year
1865 near Harpenden station on the Great Northern
railway, and Barkway has yielded a fine bronze statuette
of Mars.</p>

<p>Reference may here be made to the ancient millstones,
for hand use, made of Hertfordshire pudding-stone,
and known as querns, of which the writer gave two fine
specimens from Harpenden to the British Museum. Both
stones have one flat and one convex surface, but the
convexity is much greater in the upper stone, which is
almost conical, and is completely perforated at the centre.
When in use, a stick, to serve as the axis of rotation, was
inserted in this hole and received in a socket in the nether
stone. The labour involved in making these pudding-stone
querns must have been enormous.</p>

<p>With the Saxon period we reach the age of church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
building; but apart from such portions of certain churches
as are of that age, Hertfordshire is exceedingly poor in
evidence of the Saxon dominion. A glass Anglo-Saxon
basin, together with a bronze Frankish pot of late sixth
or early seventh century work, was, however, discovered
at Wheathampstead in 1886. Anglo-Saxon relics are
believed also to have been unearthed at Redbourn at a
very early period, when they were attributed to <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Amphibalus;
and a Saxon burial-place appears to have been found
near Sandridge in modern times, although unfortunately
ploughed over. Apart from the above, there are only a
few isolated “finds,” such as of the coins known as
minimi, and of a gold ornament discovered at Park Street
in 1744.</p>

<h2><a name="Section_16" id="Section_16"><span class="spaced">16. Architecture. <span  class="notbold">(<i>a</i>)</span> <span class="less">E</span>cclesiastical</span></a>&mdash;Abbeys and Churches.</h2>

<p>The architecture of Hertfordshire buildings may be
most conveniently discussed under three separate sections,
namely:&mdash;(<i>a</i>) ecclesiastical, or buildings related to the
church; (<i>b</i>) <a href="#Section_17" title="Go to section 17.">military</a>, or castles; and (<i>c</i>) <a href="#Section_18" title="Go to section 18.">domestic</a>, or
dwelling houses and cottages.</p>

<p>As in England generally, the architecture of the older
buildings of all three classes has been affected to a greater
or less degree by the nature of the building materials most
easily accessible. Throughout the northern chalk area of
the county the Totternhoe stone of Bedfordshire and the
northern flanks of Hertfordshire was largely employed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
church building, both for inside and outside work, to the
latter of which it is but ill suited. Flint&mdash;in the better
class of work “faced” or “dressed” by fracture so as to
present a flattened outer face&mdash;was also very extensively
used. The Norman builders of the tower of <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans found,
however, a quarry ready to their hands in the adjacent
walls of Verulam, and we accordingly find this part of
the structure made almost entirely of the characteristic
Roman bricks or tiles. Contemporaneous brick was also
locally used to a very considerable extent even in the
chalk districts; and in the north-western part of the
county there are numerous beautiful examples of Tudor
brick chimneys, as at Water End. Timber in the old
days was, however, much cheaper than bricks, and we
consequently find many of the older buildings&mdash;especially
cottages&mdash;constructed of a framework of wood, arranged
in the fashion of a net, with the large “meshes” filled in
with brick. This type of work is locally known as brick
and studding and to the architect as half-timbered work.
Other buildings were largely constructed of a wooden
framework overlain with lath-and-plaster work.</p>

<p>Many of the churches built of flint or Totternhoe
stone have their angles or quoins made of harder material;
in many instances of stone apparently from Northamptonshire,
but in other cases of Roman brick; similar materials
being also used in the arches of some of the churches.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <img width="550" height="377" src="images/i_099.jpg" alt="St Peters, Tewin" id="i_099" />
    <p class="caption"><abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Peter’s, Tewin</p>
  </div>

<p>A large number of Hertfordshire churches have
relatively low battlemented towers, frequently with a
short spire or steeple in the centre as at Tewin, or a
turret in one corner. Kensworth is an example of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
a battlemented tower without either spire or turret; <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr>
Mary’s, Hitchin, Tring, Northchurch, Barnet, Bushey,
King’s Walden, Cheshunt, and Watford are examples of
towers with a turret in one angle, while at Ashwell there
are turrets in all four corners. Some of the smaller
churches, like <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Michael’s, <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans, originally had no
aisles. Clothall church is peculiar in that the roof of
the tower forms a four-sided cone; while the roof of the
church at Sarratt is equally unique in being saddle-backed,
that is to say, having a ridge running at right angles to
that of the roof of the nave and chancel.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">

    <p class="caption"><abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Mary’s, Cheshunt</p>
  </div>

<p>Apparently there is no wholly Saxon church in the
county, although several of the older ones were con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>structed
on the site of Saxon buildings, many of which
were probably of wood, and thus either perished through
decay or were burnt during the Danish raids. On the
other hand, there are remains of Saxon work in <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans’
Abbey, and there are several Hertfordshire churches which
are referred with a greater or less degree of certainty to
the period before the Norman conquest; the original part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
of <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Michael’s, in <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans, and of <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Stephen’s, to the
south-west of that town, may be cited as examples, both
dating from the middle of the tenth century. The
church of Sandridge&mdash;on the road from <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans to
Wheathampstead&mdash;may likewise date from the same
epoch.</p>

    <p class="caption"><abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Mary’s, Hemel Hempstead</p>
  </div>

<p>Of Norman churches there are numerous examples,
among which may be cited as a fine specimen <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Mary’s,
Hemel Hempstead, whose tall octagonal tower and spire
are visible from a long distance. The Norman arches of
the nave are of great solidity, while the western doorway,
dating from about 1140, is a magnificent example of the
work of the period. Sarratt church is also largely Norman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
as was also the old church of <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Nicholas, Harpenden,
unfortunately pulled down (with the exception of the
much later tower) nearly half a century ago. A considerable
portion of <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans’ Abbey (now cathedral), the
pride of the whole county, is also Norman; the tower of
Roman brick being, apart from modern additions, wholly
of that period. The old Saxon Church of King Offa,
which stood on or near the site of the present building,
appears to have been completely swept away by Abbot
Paul of Caen (1077–1093), the founder of the present
abbey, which although completed by him, was not consecrated
till 1115. “It is to be inferred,” according to the
<cite>Victoria History of Hertfordshire</cite>, “that a clean sweep was
made of the old buildings, and no evidence as to their site
has been preserved. The Norman Abbot’s contempt for
his Saxon predecessors ... led him to destroy their tombs,
and he doubtless laid out his new building without
attempting in any way to accommodate them to those
previously existing on the site. But he preserved and
used up in his new church some of the stonework of the
old building, giving a very prominent place to the turned
shafts which still remain in the transept, and are the most
notable relics of the Saxon building.” In the present
nave, which is the second longest in England, the first six
pillars on the north side belong to the original structure
of Abbot Paul; after which we come to Early English
(Pointed) work; this being continued to the west end of
the building and back to the fifth pillar on the south side,
whence Decorated work extends to <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Cuthbert’s screen.
The Norman work (1077–1093) of one side thus faces
Decorated work (1308–1326) on the other, but this is
due to accident rather than design, the Norman pillars
having given way early in the church’s history. It has
recently been suggested that the Abbey stands on the site
of the old Roman amphitheatre, and that <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Peter’s Street,
<abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans, marks the position of the Roman <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cursus</i>, or
race-course.</p>

Albans’ Abbey, we have examples in Abbot’s Langley,
Clothall, and Hitchin churches. Abbot’s Langley has
also some fine Norman work in the nave. Many of the
churches of the Perpendicular period, like <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Mary’s,
Hitchin, have large and beautiful porches. Most of the
windows in Abbot’s Langley church are Perpendicular,
although some on the south side are Decorated; and
Tring and Offley churches are wholly of the Perpendicular
style.</p>

<p>Previous to the Reformation, Hertfordshire, like other
counties, possessed numerous religious houses, such as
priories, monasteries, nunneries, and hospitals; all of
which, commencing with the smaller ones, were suppressed
by Henry <abbr title="the Eight">VIII</abbr>, whose chief agent in the work
was Thomas Cromwell. In many instances the sole
evidence of the existence of such establishments is the
survival of the word “Abbey” or “Priory” as the name
of a private mansion, but sometimes their gateways,
towers, or merely ruins, still remain.</p>

<p>The neighbourhood of <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans is especially rich in
relics of this nature. To the south, on the banks of the
Ver, are the famous ruined walls of Sopwell Nunnery, a
building known to have been in existence so early as
1119; but of the monastery there remains only the fine
gate-house (long misused as a gaol), together with traces
of the cloister arches on the south wall of the abbey.
From documentary evidence, however, aided by excavations
in the abbey orchard, it has been found possible to
make a ground-plan of the whole establishment. The
last traces of the hospital of <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Mary-de-Pré vanished only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
during the last century; the name surviving in a private
house by the Ver, which is known as the Pré.</p>

<p>Hitchin formerly possessed a large priory, as is indicated
by the designation of the home of the Delmé-Radcliffes;
as well as by the existence in the town itself of certain
almshouses known as the “Biggin.” The latter were
purchased by a private gentleman in 1545, being at that
time part of the disestablished “Priory of Bygyng in the
town of Hychen.” The Biggin, which was once inhabited
by Gilbertine nuns, has a beautiful wooden
corridor. “The Priory” as the title of a house in the
main street of Redbourn, and “The Cell” as that of a
mansion further down the road, at Markyate, are but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>

<p>Of King’s Langley Priory, which is known to have
been in existence in 1400, a considerable portion still
exists. Ashridge House now occupies the site of a large
monastery and college, of which there are many remains.
A brief reference may here be made to <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans’ clock-tower,
which was erected between 1403 and 1412, and

<h2><a name="Section_17" id="Section_17"><span class="spaced">17. Architecture. <span  class="notbold">(<i>b</i>)</span> <span class="less">M</span>ilitary</span></a>&mdash;Castles.</h2>

<p>Like most other counties in the south of England,
Hertfordshire possesses the remains of several Norman
castles, most of which appear to date back no further than
the Conquest, while others, like Berkhampstead (where, as
we have seen in a previous section, Mercian kings held
their courts), have been supposed to be constructed on the
site of earlier buildings of a similar nature.</p>

<p>The total number of castles built by the Normans to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
overawe their new English subjects is stated to have
been about 1100. These, as may naturally be surmised,
varied considerably in size, some being royal castles,
constructed for the defence of the country generally and
ruled by a constable or guardian, while others belonged to
individual Norman noblemen for the defence of their own
estates, and were for the most part the terror of the
surrounding districts.</p>

<p>A Norman castle of the highest type occupied a large
area, the lofty and massive outer wall enclosing a space
of several acres, and being surmounted with towers and
protected by bastions, while it was also surrounded by a
moat or ditch. Within the enclosure thus formed were
three main divisions, the first of which was the outer
bailey, or courtyard, entered by a towered gateway
furnished with a portcullis (that is to say, a gate which
could be dropped down from, and drawn up into, the
tower by means of a system of chains and pulleys) and a
drawbridge. The stables and other buildings were contained
in this court. Next came the inner bailey, or
quadrangle, likewise entered through a towered and fortified
gateway, and containing the chapel, the barracks, and
the keep. Lastly, we have the keep or donjon itself,
which always contained a well, and constituted the final
portion which was defended during a protracted siege
when the garrison was hard pressed. In choosing the site
for such a military castle, either a more or less isolated
and steep hill or rock might be selected, or a situation in
marshy low-lands, where access might be rendered difficult
or impossible by damming back the waters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span></p>

<p>The Norman castle at Berkhampstead, which stood
close to the present railway due east of the station, and
portions of the ruins of which may be seen from the train,
was built by Robert Earl of Morton, brother of William
the Conqueror. According to a recent writer, the earthworks
of this castle represent the original fortress founded
by the Conqueror, and the appellation of a “burh” to the
structure is consequently erroneous. A Saxon “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">burh</span>” or
“<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">burg</span>” was a fortified town, whereas the moated mound of
Berkhampstead, like those at Hertford, Bishop’s Stortford,
Anstey, Bennington, and Pirton, are essentially Norman
castles of the type known as “mottes,” or, from their
shape, as “mount and bailey castles.” It is a common
idea that Berkhampstead was originally a stone castle, but
the earthworks now remaining really represent the fortress
itself. In the reign of Henry <abbr title="the Second">II</abbr> the custody of Berkhampstead
Castle was entrusted to Thomas à Becket, who
replaced the old wooden defences (such as stockades,
palisades, and towers) originally crowning the banks, by
walls of flint rubble, remains of which still partly surround
the enclosure.</p>

<p>Hertford Castle, the site of which forms the residence
of His Majesty’s judges during the assizes, was built by
Edward the Elder about the year 905; and after the
conquest William <abbr title="the First">I</abbr> placed both castle and town in the
custody of Peter de Valoignes. Other ancient castles and
baileys in the county include the following, viz:&mdash;</p>

<p>Anstey Castle, situated about a mile from the eastern
border of Hertfordshire, on the watershed between the
Stort and the Quin. Bennington Castle, built on high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
ground about a mile from the river Beane and some two
miles from Walkern Bury; the ruins include the remains
of a small, square keep, as well as of a bailey. Waytemore
Castle, Bishop’s Stortford, belonging to the Bishop
of London, is an excellent example of the type of fortress
which owes the main part of its strength to being situated
in a practically impassable morass; that is to say, when
the latter was kept well flooded. The flint rubble walls
of the keep are fully a dozen feet in thickness.</p>

<p>Smaller baileys existed at High Down, near Pirton;
at Periwinkle Hill, on nearly level ground, midway
between Reed and Barkway; and also at Walkern, on
the Beane, about a mile and a half distant from the
village. In the last of these it is noteworthy that the
church is situated close to the castle, although, unlike the
one at Anstey, it does not appear to have been included
in an outer ward.</p>

<p>The class of defensive works known as homestead
moats&mdash;that is to say, simple enclosures formed into
islands by means of moats containing water&mdash;do not,
perhaps, strictly speaking, come under the title of either
architectural or military structures. Still this seems the
most convenient place in which to mention them. The
northern and eastern districts of Hertfordshire are remarkable
for the enormous number of these homestead moats;
these districts being equalled in this respect only by Essex
and Suffolk. On the western side of the county they are
comparatively uncommon.</p>

<p>“These enclosures,” observes a writer in the <cite>Victoria
History</cite> of the county, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>“vary greatly in size, shape, and
position, and it is obvious that they do not all belong
to one period, for in all ages to surround a piece of land
with a ditch has been one of the most elementary forms
of defence. There are, however, as with the larger
earthworks, certain typical forms.... It should be noted
that the typical feature of a homestead moat is that the
earth, dug to form the deep surrounding ditch, was thrown
on to the inclosure and spread, thus raising the island
slightly above the surrounding level. The construction
of moats, except for ornamental purposes, having ceased
when the state of the country no longer necessitated such
protective measures against men or wild beasts, they often
fell into decay, or were partially filled up, and their
vestiges converted into ponds, while many may have been
obliterated as interfering with agriculture, but there still
remain a large number.”</p>

<p>To reproduce the list of these would occupy far too
much space; and it must suffice to mention that examples
of homestead moats may be seen in the parishes of
Ashwell, Braughing, Pirton, and Sawbridgeworth.</p>

<p>A step in advance of the homestead moat was formed
by earthworks made on the same plan as the latter, but
provided with a rampart and a “fosse,” or ditch, and in
some cases also with outer defences. Of this type of
earthwork three examples are definitely known to occur
in the county, namely one at Bygrave, a second at
Whomerley Wood to the south-east of Stevenage, and
a third at Well Wood, Watton.</p>

<p>Yet another kind of defensive earthwork is to be
found in the shape of walls, ramparts, or ditches sur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>rounding
the sites of ancient villages. Of this we have
a local example in Kingsbury Castle, an old fortified
village lying to the south-west of the city of <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans,
and covering an area of about 27½ acres. The village
stood upon a hill, of which the summit has been planed
off and the material employed to form steep banks or
ramparts, one of which was partially thrown down to
form the present Verulam Road, while another portion
persists in the shape of a steep fall in the gardens or yards
at the back of the houses on the north side of Fishpool
Street. The main structure of the castle was demolished
during the tenth century, and the remnant about the year
1152. It may be added that the clay-pits on the north
side of Kingsbury Castle are the reputed source of the
material of the Roman bricks of which Verulam is built.</p>

<p>The gigantic earthworks of the type of Beech Bottom
and Grimm’s Dyke have been mentioned in an earlier
section.</p>

<p>With the advent of less troublous times at the close of
the Wars of the Roses a marked change is noticeable in the
plan and architecture of the residences of the great noblemen
and country gentlemen. The need for castles or
fortified houses ceased to exist; and attention was
consequently directed to comfort rather than strength<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
in the construction of country mansions. Fortunately
a number of these fine old Tudor residences have survived
in different parts of the country; but many have
been replaced by other later structures built on the old
foundations.</p>

<p>These Tudor mansions usually took the form of
a large house built round a quadrangle, the hall occupying
the middle portion of the building, with flanking wings
on both sides. The building material depended upon the
locality and on the taste and means of the owner; but in
this county brick was extensively employed by the Tudor,
and still more so by the Stuart builders.</p>

<p>In lordly country seats, as well as in mansions of
a less pretentious type, dating from the Tudor period
downward, Hertfordshire, owing doubtless to its well-wooded
and picturesque scenery, its good soil, bracing
climate, and proximity to the metropolis, is especially
rich, and in this respect presents a marked contrast to the
neighbouring county of Essex. The majority of these
houses, however, have been either completely rebuilt or
more or less extensively altered at later epochs.</p>

    <p class="caption">Hatfield House, South Front</p>
  </div>

<p>Among the few of these noble residences that can be
mentioned here, Hatfield House, which was built between
the years 1605 and 1611 by the first Earl of Salisbury,
presents a magnificent specimen of early Jacobean architecture
in brick and stone, mellowed by time to exquisitely
soft tints. The original palace, where Edward <abbr title="the Sixth">VI</abbr> lived,
and where Elizabeth was kept in captivity, now forms
the stables. The mention of the virgin queen naturally
leads on to Ashridge, near Berkhampstead, formerly the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
seat of the Dukes of Bridgewater, where Elizabeth also
spent a considerable time in her early days. Although the
present building, which stands partly in Hertfordshire and
partly in Buckinghamshire, is mostly modern Gothic, the
fine vaulted cellar is a remnant of the old monastery and
college which formerly occupied the site. Knebworth,
near Stevenage, the home of the Earls of Lytton, although
now a comparatively modern Gothic building, was
originally a Tudor mansion, dating from the reign of
Henry <abbr title="the Seventh">VII</abbr>, the present house occupying the position
of one of the four wings of the original building.
Tittenhanger, between <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans and Colney, occupies
the site of a royal residence dating from the fourteenth
and early part of the fifteenth century; the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
mansion, notable for its grand oak staircase, is stated to
have been built in 1654, although the style of the brickwork
suggests the early part of the eighteenth century.
Little Hadham Hall, at the village of that name, is
a splendid example of Elizabethan architecture in red
brick.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">

    <p class="caption">Knebworth</p>
  </div>

<p>A very interesting mansion is Salisbury House, Shenley,
built some time before 1669; much of the original brick
building still remaining as an excellent example of Stuart
architecture. The house is surrounded by a broad moat,
and is approached by a bridge. Mackery End, near
Wheathampstead, contains some fine examples of sixteenth
century architecture; and Rothamsted, near Harpenden,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
is in the main a seventeenth century brick mansion,
dating from between 1630 and 1650, although it has
older portions, and the hall belonged to a house constructed
of timber on a flint base.</p>

<p>Of fine old houses now forming farm-homesteads there
are many examples on the western side of the county.
Among these is Turner’s Hall, to the north-west of
Harpenden, now considerably modernised.</p>

    <p class="caption">(<i>Elizabethan Manor-House</i>)]</p>
  </div>

<p>Another very interesting building of this type is
Water End Farm, in the parish of Sandridge, situated on
the banks of the Lea about two miles from Wheathampstead,
and stated to have been built about 1610. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
is constructed of brick and has the straight-gabled, mullioned
style characteristic of the later part of the reign of
Elizabeth and the commencement of that of James <abbr title="the First">I</abbr>.
Like many other houses of Elizabethan times it is
constructed in the form of the letter E, and its three
stacks of brick chimneys, with octagonal shafts and
moulded brick caps and bases, are especially characteristic
of the style of this period.</p>

<p>Of later date are the Marlborough Buildings, or
Almshouses, <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans, erected by Sarah, Duchess of
Marlborough in 1736, and affording a fine example of
the brick architecture of that period in an excellent state
of preservation. Here also may be mentioned the Blue-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>Coat

<p>Forty years ago the county abounded in picturesque
brick-and-timber cottages, roofed with either tiles or
thatch; but these are disappearing yearly under the hand
of the speculative builder, to be replaced by hideous box-like
buildings of brick and slate. Some, however, still
survive, either in the towns or the smaller hamlets, such
as picturesque Amswell, near Wheathampstead, which
may be cited as an ideal example of one of the smaller
Hertfordshire villages.</p>

<p>As has been well remarked in another volume of the
present series, the great difference between these ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
cottages and houses and the great majority of their
modern successors is that while the former harmonise
with their surroundings, reflect not a little of the spirit of
the builder, and improve, like good wine, with age, the
latter are altogether out of keeping, and are likely to
become, if possible, still more offensive and objectionable
with the advance of time.</p>

<p>While most of the old Hertfordshire cottages were of
brick and timber, others were built of flint with brick
facings, or more rarely of rounded pebbles from the
Woolwich and Reading beds, or with brick courses and
window-mullions; some were of feather-edge boarding,
and others again of rubble and plaster.</p>

<p>In Hemel Hempstead High Street is a building, now
converted into cottages, which contains above the fireplaces
on the ground and first floors the Tudor rose and
fleur-de-lys in plaster-work; while the back of a neighbouring
building probably dates from the time of
Henry <abbr title="the Eight">VIII</abbr>. Excellent examples of the old brick-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>and-timber
cottages are to be seen in the village of
Northchurch, and also at Aldbury, east of Tring, where
the old parish stocks are likewise preserved. Most of
these Aldbury cottages are tiled, although a few are
covered with thatch, a style of roofing much less common
in that district than in many parts of the county.
Watford has still a number of old cottages, notably in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
Farthing Lane and Chequer’s Yard, and in <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans,
especially in the market-place and French Row, there
are several dating from the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries. There is also a very remarkable old hexagonal
wooden house near the ford across the Ver at <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Michael’s
silk-mills, said to be one of the oldest licensed houses in
England.</p>

<p>Did space permit, reference might be made to old
houses in Hertford, Berkhampstead, and other towns and
villages, but the facts mentioned are sufficient to indicate
the interest of the county to antiquarians in the matter of
ancient buildings, and before concluding this section we
must not omit to mention what is certainly not the least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
interesting of all Hertfordshire antiquities&mdash;the Cross at

<p>Lying as it does on the direct route from the metropolis
to the north and north-west of England, and containing
in its western portion the formerly important city of
Verulam, Hertfordshire, as might be expected, is traversed
by several trunk roads leading in those directions, two
of which date from Roman times. What these lines of
communication were in pre-Roman days we have no
means of knowing, although it is probable that they were
little more than rude tracks through the great forest, or
“weald,” which in those days extended some forty miles
to the north of London, and afforded shelter to the great
wild ox, red deer, wild boars, bears, and wolves. Road-making
was a special attribute of the ancient Romans;
and after they had constructed highways from their early
stations in Kent, they probably set to work on those in the
counties to the northward of London. So well made and
so straight were these ancient Roman roads that many of
them (with in some cases a certain amount of local deviation)
have remained the main highways of the country down to
the present day. Immediately before the introduction of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
railways, when the coaching traffic was brought to its
highest pitch of development, these main trunk roads&mdash;thanks
to the invention of Macadam&mdash;were maintained
in superb condition, though with the extension of the
railway system some of them were allowed to deteriorate.</p>

<p>There are three great Roman roads traversing
Hertfordshire&mdash;Watling Street, the Icknield Way, and
Ermine Street. Watling Street starts from Dover, and
after passing through London, enters the county to the
south of Elstree, whence it is continued through Colney
Street, Park Street and <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Stephens to <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans, and
thence on through Redbourn and Markyate Street, and
so to Dunstable whence it eventually reached Chester
and Holyhead. Although frequently miscalled the North
Road, the modern representative of Watling Street is
known as the Chester and Holyhead road. Originally
the Roman road in the neighbourhood of <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans ran
altogether to the west of the Ver, from Gorham Block to
the Pondyards; this section of the modern road, which
crosses the river to enter the city, having been constructed
during the years 1826–1834.</p>

line of the chalk downs. It may be called a cross-country
road from the west of England, cutting the
Watling Street at Dunstable, and thence extending in
a north-easterly direction across Hertfordshire through
Little Offley, Ickleford, and Baldock, and thence by
way of Royston, where it crosses the Ermine Street, to
Newmarket and Yarmouth.</p>

<p>The Ermine Street, the third great Roman road, takes,
on the other hand, a northern direction, passing through
Cheshunt, Wormley, Broxbourne, and Wadesmill, and so
by way of Buntingford to Royston. There is however
some difference of opinion about its course.</p>

  </div>

<p>Of modern roads, the Chester and Holyhead road has
been already mentioned as following in the main the line
of the Old Watling Street. Of equal importance is the
Great North Road to York, passing through Barnet,
Hatfield, Welwyn, Codicote, Stevenage, and Hitchin.
Of other highways it must suffice to mention that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
Bedford road branches off from the Chester and Holyhead
at <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans to run through Harpenden, and so on to
Luton, in Bedfordshire; while the main road from
London to Cambridge and Norwich takes the line of
the Lea valley on the eastern side of the county, which
it leaves a short distance to the northward of Bishop’s
Stortford.</p>

    <p class="caption">View on the ‘Great North Road,’ Codicote Village</p>
  </div>

<p>In coaching days <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans was a far more bustling
and busy town than it is at the present day; a very large
number of coaches passing daily through the city each
way, the majority running on the Holyhead and Chester
road, but a certain number taking the Bedford line. The
two chief coaching and posting inns were the Peahen and
the White Hart, both of which are still in existence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span></p>

<p>The speed and smartness with which the mail-coaches
were run in the days immediately preceding their
abolition was little short of marvellous.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <img width="550" height="361" src="images/i_131.jpg" alt="Watford" id="i_131" />
    <p class="caption">Watford</p>
  </div>

<p>The first half of the nineteenth century saw the
introduction of railways, which gradually but surely killed
the old coaching traffic. One of the first lines to be
opened was the London and North-Western&mdash;in 1838&mdash;which
traverses the south-western side of the county,
passing through Watford, Boxmoor, Berkhampstead, and
the outskirts of Tring. In 1853 a branch line was opened
from Watford to <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans, and another to Rickmansworth
in 1862. With a short break between Boxmoor and
Hemel Hempstead, the North-Western system is connected
with the Midland by means of a branch line from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
the last-named town to Harpenden. The main line of the
Midland, which traverses the western half of the county
by way of Elstree, <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans, and Harpenden, was opened
in 1868. Both <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans and Harpenden have branches
of the Great Northern Railway to Hatfield, which is on
the main line; the latter continuing through Welwyn,
Stevenage, and Hitchin. By means of a branch line of
the Great Northern from Hatfield to Hertford, we reach
the Great Eastern, the fourth great railway in the county,
the main line of which runs through Broxbourne, Sawbridgeworth,
and Bishop’s Stortford, but connected also
with Ware and Hertford, and having a branch from
<abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Margaret’s to Buntingford.</p>

<p>With such a multiplicity of lines, it might well be
imagined that railway communication between nearly all
parts of the county would be well-nigh perfect. As
a matter of fact, this is by no means the case; and the
journey by rail from the western to the eastern side, owing
to changes and delays, is so slow and tedious, that it is frequently
found convenient to hold important Hertfordshire
meetings, like those of the County Council, in London.</p>

<p>As regards water-communication, the western side of
the county is served by the Grand Junction Canal, which,
after leaving Leighton Buzzard, enters the county near
Tring, and thence runs by way of Berkhampstead, Boxmoor,
Hemel Hempstead, Runton Bridge, Watford and
Rickmansworth in a south-easterly and southerly direction
to London. A considerable amount of barge-traffic is still
carried on this canal, although nothing approaching
that in pre-railway times. In those days the whole of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
the coal-supply for north-western Herts came by canal to
Boxmoor, whence it had to be carted for long distances&mdash;some
14 miles to Harpenden, for instance. As there are
at least two very steep hills&mdash;which become impossible for
heavily laden teams when the roads are slippery&mdash;between
Boxmoor and Harpenden, the inhabitants of the latter
picturesque village were apt to run short of firing at
Christmas.</p>

    <p class="caption">The Grand Junction Canal near Hemel Hempstead</p>
  </div>

<p>On the other side of the county the Lea is navigable
for barges as far up as Ware and Hertford; and here too
a considerable amount of heavy traffic is still carried on by
water.</p>

<p>In this place mention may conveniently be made of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
the New River, running from the valley of the Lea near
the Rye House, at a gradually increasing distance from
that river, to the metropolis. The New River, or
Middleton’s Waters, as it used also to be called, was
constructed in the reign of James <abbr title="the First">I</abbr>, at first almost
entirely by Sir Hugh Middleton, but later on by a company
with a special charter, for the purpose of supplying
north London with drinking-water. The chief sources
of the New River are the springs at Chadwell and
Amwell. At the present time an original £100 share in
the New River Company is worth an almost fabulous
price.</p>

<h2><a name="Section_20" id="Section_20"><span class="spaced">20. Administration</span> and Divisions&mdash;Ancient and Modern.</a></h2>

<p>The present administration and administrative divisions
of Hertfordshire, like those of other English counties,
have been gradually evolved and developed from those of
our Saxon forefathers; each alteration in the form of local
government and of local administrative boundaries being
based on the previously existing system. By the Saxons
each county was divided into a number of main divisions
known as hundreds, or wapentakes, each governed by a
hundreder, or centenary (the equivalent of the Old German
<i lang="goh" xml:lang="goh">Zentgrafen</i>), and each having a name of its own. Hertfordshire
is now divided into eight hundreds, the names
of which, commencing on the western side of the county,
are as follows: Dacorum (including Tring), Cassio (with
the important towns of <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans, Watford, and Rick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>mansworth),
Hertford, Braughing, Broadwater (occupying
nearly the centre), Hitchin and Pirton (on the north-west
corner), Odsey (in the extreme north), and Edwinstree
(on the north-east). Originally they were more numerous,
Cassio, for instance, being much smaller than at present,
while the Hitchin division was reckoned only as a half-hundred.
The origin of the names of most of the
hundreds are self-apparent; but that of Cassio (originally
Kayso) appears to be unknown, while that of Dacorum
has some connection with the Danes, perhaps referring
to a Danish settlement.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable facts connected with
the hundreds of Hertfordshire is that three of them do
not lie within what farmers call a ring-fence. Dacorum,
for instance, has two outlying areas in the south-eastern
corner of Cassio, and a third wedged in between Cassio
on the west, Broadwater on the north, and an outlying
portion of Cassio on the east. Broadwater, again, has a
small outlier on the Middlesex border of the south-eastern
“peninsula” of Cassio; while Cassio itself, inclusive of
the one already mentioned, has no less than eight of these
curious outliers, one situated in the extreme north in the
hundred of Odsey.</p>

<p>Each hundred originally had its own court, or “hundred-mote,”
which met monthly; and it was divided, as at
present, into townships, or parishes. The parish, in turn,
had its own council, or <i>gemot</i>, where every freeman had
a right to appear. This assembly or council made its
own local by-laws, to enforce which it had a reeve, a
bailiff, and a tithingman, with the powers of a constable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
The reeve was chairman of the township <i>gemot</i>, and
could summon that assembly at pleasure.</p>

<p>Passing on to more modern times, we find Hertfordshire
occupying a peculiar position in regard to local
government and administration in that it possessed a kind
of <i>imperium in imperio</i> in the shape of what was known
as the Liberty of <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Alban; in other words, a large area
on the western side of the county originally under the
jurisdiction of the abbots of <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans, who had the
power of inflicting the death-penalty. Originally there
was a separate Commission of the Peace for the Liberty,
so that a Justice for the County had no jurisdiction in
the former unless he had been specially inducted. This
arrangement was found, however, to be inconvenient,
and the Liberty, as such, was abolished, although it was
taken as a basis for the splitting of the county into a
western and an eastern division for judicial purposes.</p>

<p>The chief officers of the county are the Lord Lieutenant
and the High Sheriff; the former (who in Hertfordshire
is always a nobleman) being the direct local
representative of the sovereign, and having the appointment
of magistrates and the officers of the territorial
forces, while the latter (who is a commoner) is the head
of the executive department in the administration of
justice. The Lord Lieutenant holds office for life, or
during the sovereign’s pleasure, but the Sheriff is appointed
annually by the Crown. Deputy Lieutenants are supposed
to act, in case of need, for the Lord Lieutenant.</p>

<p>Formerly the greater part of the business of the
county was conducted by the Justices of the Peace, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
Magistrates, at Quarter Sessions, but most of this is now
transferred to the County Council, which, as previously
stated, often meets in London. This County Council,
which was first established in 1888, is composed of
Aldermen and Councillors; the latter of whom are elected,
while the former are what is called “co-opted,” that is
to say, selected by the Council itself, either from its own
body, or from the general public. The duties of the
County Council include the maintenance of high roads
and bridges; the appointment and control, in conjunction
with the magistrates, of the police; the management of
reformatories and lunatic asylums; and, in a word, the
general carrying out of the laws enacted by Parliament.</p>

<p>According to a scheme elaborated in an Act of Parliament
passed in 1894, the more important minor local
bodies are denominated District Councils, and those whose
function is less Parish Councils; the former having
control of the more populous towns and villages, other
than cities and boroughs, and the latter those with fewer
inhabitants. For this purpose many parishes are divided
into a more populous Urban and a less populous Rural
District. Certain towns in the county rank, however,
as cities, or boroughs, and have larger powers and different
forms of government; being ruled by a Mayor and
Corporation, and having magistrates and a police force
distinct from those of the county. Among these privileged
towns, <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans ranks as a city, while Hertford and
Hemel Hempstead are boroughs. Hemel Hempstead is a
very ancient borough, and has, in addition to its Mayor,
an official known as the High Bailiff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span></p>

<p>The county is likewise divided into a number of
Poor Law Unions, each with a Board of Guardians,
whose duty it is to manage the workhouses, and appoint
officers to carry out the work of relieving the poor and
those incapacitated by age or other cause from earning
their own living.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <img width="550" height="387" src="images/i_139.jpg" alt="The Shire Hall, Hertford" id="i_139" />
    <p class="caption">The Shire Hall, Hertford</p>
  </div>

<p>As regards the administration of justice, Assizes are
held by His Majesty’s Judges three or four times a year
at the Shire Hall, Hertford, for the whole county; the
Grand Jury on such occasions being composed entirely,
or mainly, of magistrates. Quarter Sessions, on the other
hand, are held four times a year at Hertford for the
eastern, and at the Court House, <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
western division of the county; these courts being constituted
by the magistrates for the county and the mayors
of the boroughs and city. Petty Sessions are held weekly,
fortnightly, or monthly at a number of the towns and larger
villages. In most cases the county magistrates in the
immediate neighbourhood preside at these sessions; but
the city of <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans and the two boroughs have magistrates
of their own, who also hold petty sessions for trying
cases which occur within the area of their jurisdiction.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans is the centre of an episcopal diocese, which
includes most of that portion of London situated within
the county of Essex. Arrangements are, however, now
in progress for relieving the Bishop of <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans of the
care of that part of the diocese commonly known as
“London Over the Border.”</p>

<p>The diocese, so far as Hertfordshire is concerned, is
divided into archdeaconries, rural deaneries, and parishes.
The latter are very numerous, although somewhat less
so than the civil parishes, for the purposes of which, as
already mentioned, the ecclesiastical parishes are frequently
split into an urban and a rural section. There are 170
ecclesiastical parishes situated wholly or partly within the
old county, of which 164 are included in the diocese
of <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans; while three belong to Ely, two to Oxford,
and part of one (Northwood) to London.</p>

<p>The larger towns, the city, and the two boroughs
have Education Committees of their own; but for the
rest of the county a Committee of this nature is appointed
by the County Council.</p>

<p>Hertfordshire has four parliamentary divisions, namely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
Hertford, Hitchin, <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans, and Watford, each of which
returns one member to the House of Commons. The
county is thus represented only by four members, as
against fifteen for Kent.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="Section_21" id="Section_21"><span class="spaced">21. The</span> Roll of Honour of the County.</a></h2>

<p>Hertfordshire cannot hope to rival such counties as
Norfolk or Kent in its roll of distinguished names, but it
can show a fairly long list of persons connected with the
county who have been famous.</p>

<p>Since reference has already been made in several of
the foregoing sections to the visits of English sovereigns
to the county, or to their residence within its borders,
very brief mention of the connection between royalty
and the county will suffice in this place. Neither here
nor elsewhere in these pages is any attempt made to
give a complete list of such visits.</p>

<p>The names of Boadicea, queen of the Iceni, and of
Offa, king of Mercia, who had his palace at Offley, dying
there in 796, will always be specially connected with
Hertfordshire. In a somewhat less degree the same may
be said of William the Conqueror, to whom, as already
mentioned, the crown of this realm was offered at
Berkhampstead. Edward <abbr title="the Second">II</abbr> and Edward <abbr title="the Third">III</abbr> frequently
resided at Langley Palace, where Edmund de Langley,
the founder of the White Rose faction, was born in
1341; and the same residence was also used by Richard <abbr title="the Second">II</abbr>.
Henry <abbr title="the First">I</abbr> and his consort Matilda were present at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
dedication of <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans’ Abbey on its completion by
Abbot Paul; and Henry <abbr title="the Sixth">VI</abbr> was at the first battle of
<abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans, where he was wounded. Henry <abbr title="the Eight">VIII</abbr>, as
mentioned on page 82, was still more intimately connected
with Hertfordshire, and the manor of Hitchin
was conferred by him in turn on Anne Boleyn and her
successors. Reference has already been made to the
residence of Queen Mary, in her youth, at Ashridge,
and of Queen Elizabeth (before her ascent to the throne)
both there and at Hatfield; while, as sovereign, Elizabeth
also visited <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans on two or three occasions as the
guest of Sir Nicholas Bacon at Gorhambury, and also
went to other great houses in the county. James <abbr title="the First">I</abbr>, as
mentioned on the same page, spent much time at Royston,
and died at Theobalds. The Rye House plot, so called
from the meeting-place of the conspirators at Broxbourne,
as stated in an earlier section, was devised for the purpose
of assassinating Charles <abbr title="the Second">II</abbr> while on his way through the
county.</p>

<p>In connection with personages of royal blood, mention
may be made of Humphry, Duke of Gloucester, whose
name is so intimately associated with <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans’ Abbey,
to the monastery of which he was admitted a member
in 1423; and also of Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough,
who was born at Sandridge in the eighteenth century,
and built and endowed the almshouses bearing her name
in <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans.</p>

<p>Among great statesmen connected with the county
a prominent place must be assigned to Queen Elizabeth’s
councillors and favourites, Lord Burleigh and the Earl of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
Essex. To her reign likewise belongs Sir Nicholas Bacon,
Keeper of the Great Seal, and owner of Gorhambury,
where he died in 1578. Nearly a century later (1652),
Gorhambury came into the possession of Sir Harbottle
Grimston, well known as Speaker of the House of
Commons.</p>

    <p class="caption">The Salisbury Statue, Hatfield</p>
  </div>

<p>Passing on to the Victorian age, we have two great
statesmen, namely, Lord Melbourne and Lord Palmerston,
both of whom lived at Brocket, where the former died;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
and, subsequently, the late Marquis of Salisbury, owner
of stately Hatfield. The first Viscount Hampden, sometime
Speaker of the House of Commons, was also a Hertfordshire
man, with his residence at Kimpton Hoo. Cecil Rhodes,
the South African premier and “Empire-builder,” likewise
claims a place in the roll of honour of the county, having
been born at Bishop’s Stortford rectory, and Commodore
Anson, the great circumnavigator, though not a native,
lived at Moor Park, where he died in 1762.</p>

<p>Dame Juliana Berners, imaginary prioress of Sopwell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
nunnery, who was supposed to have written the immortal
<cite>Treatyse on Fysshynge with an Angle</cite>, the first work on
angling ever published in England, has been shown to
be a myth. Among names famous in literature and
science the greatest connected with the county is
perhaps that of the great philosopher Sir Francis Bacon,
afterwards Lord Verulam and Viscount <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans, who,
during his father’s residence at Gorhambury, lived in
Verulam House, at the Pondyards. On the death of his
father Sir Nicholas Bacon he succeeded to Gorhambury.
By a curious error he is frequently called Lord Bacon,
although no such title was ever in existence. John
Bunyan claims a place among Hertfordshire literary
worthies as he was connected with a chapel at Hitchin.</p>

    <p class="caption">Francis Bacon, Viscount <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans</p>
  </div>

<p>Two of the greatest literary names connected with
the county are those of William Cowper the poet, and
Charles Lamb, author of the <cite>Essays of Elia</cite>, unsurpassed
as a master of delicately humorous prose, whether as
essayist or letter-writer. The former was born at
Berkhampstead rectory in the year 1731; but Lamb was
chiefly a visitor to the county, though, as he tells us in
the <cite>Essays</cite>, he was once a Hertfordshire landowner, and
his cottage at West Hill Green, about 2½ miles from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
Puckeridge, still exists. Mackery End Farm was the
residence of the Brutons, who were his relatives, and
it was to their house that his visits were made; so that
the neighbourhood is essentially Lamb’s country. It is
a question whether the Lyttons or the beauties of
Knebworth, their home, are the more famous. The
great novelist, author of <cite>The Last Days of Pompeii</cite>, <cite>The
Caxtons</cite>, and innumerable other tales, as well as such
successful plays as <cite>The Lady of Lyons</cite> and <cite>Money</cite>, was best
known to readers in the middle of the last century as
Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton, though he began life as
Mr Bulwer and died Lord Lytton. His son, poet,
Ambassador, and Viceroy, who wrote under the name of
“Owen Meredith,” was scarcely less distinguished, and
received an Earldom in 1880. Here, too, mention may
be made of Mrs Thrale, the friend of Dr Johnson, who
was often at Offley Place, where her husband, whose
family was long connected with <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans, was born.
Offley Place was at this time a fine old Elizabethan
mansion, although it has since been rebuilt. Gadebridge
Park, Hemel Hempstead, was the residence of the great
surgeon Sir Astley Paston Cooper. But a greater distinction
attaches to the name of Rothamsted, near Harpenden,
as being the residence of the late Sir John Bennet Lawes,
Bart., who, with his scientific colleague Sir Henry Gilbert,
conducted the experiments which made their names famous
throughout the agricultural world. Sir John Lawes first
obtained the idea of using fossilised phosphates for manure
from Professor Henslow, the great Cambridge botanist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
(himself sometime a resident at Hall Place, <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans),
who sent him specimens obtained from the Essex “Crag,”
with a suggestion that they might be used as a source of
phosphoric acid. Yarrell, the naturalist, lies buried in
Bayford churchyard, with many members of his family.
Last in the scientific and literary list, we have the name
of Sir John Evans, the great antiquarian and numismatist
of Nash Mills, Hemel Hempstead, who died so recently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
as 1908. To Evans, in conjunction with the late Sir
Joseph Prestwich, is mainly due the credit of definitely
establishing the fact that the so-called flint “celts” are
really the work of prehistoric man. His most important
and best work is <cite>Ancient Stone Implements</cite>.</p>

<p>Among great ecclesiastics mention must be made of
Nicholas Breakspear, born near Abbot’s Langley towards
the close of the eleventh century, who subsequently
became Pope as Adrian <abbr title="the Fourth">IV</abbr>; being the only Englishman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
who has occupied the papal chair. Reference may also
be made to Cardinal Wolsey, who spent a considerable
portion of his time at Delamere House. Nor must we
omit Young, the author of the <cite>Night Thoughts</cite> and Rector
of Welwyn, or that great maker of hymns, Dr Watts,
who as the 36-year guest of Sir Thomas Abney resided at
Theobalds, where he died. Among distinguished lawyers,
the most prominent name is that of Lord Grimthorpe
(formerly Sir Edmund Beckett), who was, however, connected
with the county, not in his professional capacity,
but as the restorer of <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans’ Abbey and other churches
in the neighbourhood. Much criticism has been expended
on Lord Grimthorpe’s modes of “restoration,” which
were certainly of a drastic character. It must, however,
be remembered that when he undertook the restoration
of <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans’ Abbey it was in a dangerous condition, and
sufficient money was not forthcoming to make it secure.
The result is that the abbey, although in many ways
unlike its former self, will stand for centuries. Lord
Grimthorpe, who was a Yorkshireman, built himself a
residence at Batchwood, near <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans.</p>

<p>As another well-known lawyer and also a judge,
mention may be made of Lord Brampton (Sir Henry
Hawkins), who came of a family long connected with
Hitchin, at which town he was born.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Chauncy, the antiquary and historian of
the county, to whom reference has so often been made in
this book, lived, and died in 1700, at Yardley; and Balfe,
the composer, made his home at Rowney Abbey, close
by, till his death in 1870.</p>

<p><b>Abbot’s Langley</b> (3342), a village situated on the Gade,
with a station on the North-Western Railway; it was bestowed
in the time of Edward the Confessor upon the then abbot of
<abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans, whence its name. Hunton Mill, on the Gade, was
granted to Sir Richard Lee in 1544, and both this and Nash
Mills were farmed from the abbot of <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans between 1349
and 1396. The present church, dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Lawrence, cannot
be traced farther back than the close of the twelfth century. A
west tower was added about 1200. (<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> <a href="#Page_72" title="Go to page 72">72</a>, <a href="#Page_90" title="Go to page 90">90</a>, <a href="#Page_105" title="Go to page 105">105</a>, <a href="#Page_149" title="Go to page 149">149</a>.)</p>

<p><b>Aldenham</b> (2437), a village and manor lying to the north-east
of Watford. It has a grammar school; and near by is
Aldenham Abbey, the seat of Lord Aldenham. In 1898 two
Roman kilns were discovered in the parish. The church, which
has been restored, contains one small twelfth-century window; no
trace of the chancel remains.</p>

<p><b>The Amwells&mdash;Great Amwell</b> (1421), and <b>Little
Amwell</b> (930)&mdash;small villages not far from the Rye House.
Amwell is associated with the name of the Quaker poet, John
Scott, who lived there for some time after 1740. Near by is
Haileybury, formerly the training college for the officials of the
East India Company, but now a public school. (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> <a href="#Page_135" title="Go to page 135">135</a>.)</p>

<p><b>Ashridge</b>, a domain in Little Gaddesden parish, situated on
the Buckinghamshire border of the county, and celebrated for its
splendid beech woods. It was formerly the property of the
Dukes of Bridgewater, being acquired by the Egertons in 1604,
but it is now owned by Earl Brownlow. A building, formerly the
porter’s lodge, includes some remains of an old monastic college.
The present house, which stands partly in Buckinghamshire, was
built by the eighth Earl of Bridgewater. (<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> <a href="#Page_115" title="Go to page 115">115</a>, <a href="#Page_142" title="Go to page 142">142</a>.)</p>

<p><b>Ashwell</b> (1281), a village on the Cambridgeshire border of
the county, with a station some distance away on the Royston and
Cambridge branch of the Great Northern Railway. Ashwell,
which was formerly a town, had a fair and a market in the time
of William the Conqueror. It was severely visited by the plague.
Its church-tower is the only one in the county built wholly of
stone. (<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> <a href="#Page_92" title="Go to page 92">92</a>, <a href="#Page_113" title="Go to page 113">113</a>.)</p>

<p><b>Baldock</b> (2057) is a market-town on the Icknield Way, to
the north-west of Hitchin, with a station on the above-mentioned
branch of the Great Northern Railway. It dates from Norman
times, when it was known as Baudok. During the Crusades,
Baldock, like <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans, Berkhampstead, and Hoddesdon, had a
lazar-house for lepers, who were at that time numerous all over
England. The list of Rectors is complete from the days of the
Knights Hospitallers in 1317. The church contains much
Decorated and Perpendicular work. (<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> <a href="#Page_90" title="Go to page 90">90</a>, <a href="#Page_94" title="Go to page 94">94</a>, <a href="#Page_128" title="Go to page 128">128</a>.)</p>

<p><b>Barkway</b> (661), originally Berkway, is a small town and
manor situated a few miles to the north-east of Buntingford.
(<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> <a href="#Page_96" title="Go to page 96">96</a>.)</p>

<p><b>Barnet</b>, or <b>Chipping Barnet</b>, originally Chipping Bernet
(7876), a large and important market-town near the Middlesex
border of the county, with a station (High Barnet) on a branch of
the Great Northern Railway. Near by are New Barnet and East
Barnet, with a station on the main line, and having a population
of 10,024. The name Barnet is a corruption of the Saxon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
<i>Bergnet</i>, signifying a little hill; the site of the town then forming
a small rising in the midst of the great forest; the prefix Chipping
= market is a word of Scandinavian origin, represented in the
Swedish Jonköping and the Danish Kjøbenhavn = (Copenhagen).
Barnet was the scene of a battle in 1471, when
the Yorkists defeated the Lancastrians, killing their leader,
Warwick the king-maker. The market was famous for its cattle;
and in addition to this there is an annual horse-fair, which
formerly attracted dealers from all parts of the country. (<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> <a href="#Page_9" title="Go to page 9">9</a>,

<p><b>East Barnet</b> (2867), known as La Barnette in the thirteenth
century, and Low Barnet in the fifteenth century, is situated on
the stream known as Pymmes’ Brook, on the western side of the
valley of which stands the almost deserted old parish church.</p>

<p><b>Bayford</b> (330), a village nearly midway between Hatfield and
Hoddesdon. In the churchyard is buried William Yarrell the
naturalist. Bayfordbury is celebrated for its collection of portraits
of members of the Kitcat Club painted by Sir Godfrey Kneller.
(<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> <a href="#Page_147" title="Go to page 147">147</a>.)</p>

<p><b>Bengeo</b> (3063), formerly Bengehoo, a village in the valley
of the Beane one mile north of Hertford. The old church, now
little used, is one of the oldest in the county, dating apparently
from the early Norman period. Together with Great Wymondley
church, it is peculiar, so far as Hertfordshire is concerned, in
having an apsidal chancel. In place of a tower, it has a wooden
bell-cote. Panshanger, formerly the property of the late Lord
Cowper, is near by.</p>

<p><b>Bennington</b> (522), a market-town and manor, situated on
the Beane, from which it takes its name; it was an important
place in the ninth century, when it was the residence of the kings
of Mercia. The church is fourteenth century. (<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> <a href="#Page_53" title="Go to page 53">53</a>, <a href="#Page_54" title="Go to page 54">54</a>, <a href="#Page_56" title="Go to page 56">56</a>,

<p><b>Berkhampstead</b>, or <b>Berkhampstead Magna</b> (5140),
an important market-town<a name="Anchor_3" id="Anchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 3.">[3]</a> on the London and North-Western
Railway and Grand Junction Canal, and one of the oldest in the
county, the castle dating from Norman times, and being possibly
on the site of an earlier Saxon edifice. It was here that the crown
of England was offered to William the Conqueror. The manor
and castle were granted first to Piers Gaveston and subsequently
to Edward the Black Prince, but were afterwards annexed to the
Duchy of Cornwall. Berkhampstead, which is now a petty-sessions
town, and has an ancient grammar school, formerly
returned burgesses to Parliament. Its almshouses were built in
1684. Cowper was born here. Berkhampstead Parva and
Berkhampstead <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Mary’s&mdash;the latter now generally known as
Northchurch&mdash;are villages in the neighbourhood. The church
dates from the thirteenth century; it contains the beautiful
Torrington tomb.

<p><b>Bishop’s Stortford</b> (7143) is the most important town on
the Essex border of the county, and has a station on the main
line of the Great Eastern Railway, and a bridge over the Stort.
The town, which has a market, possessed a considerable trade in
Saxon times, and was the property of the Bishop of London, and
to protect this, and for the purpose of consolidating his own
rights, William the Conqueror built a small castle here. Bishop’s
Stortford has a grammar school, and formerly returned members
to Parliament. The church, which dates from the tenth century,
is an imposing Perpendicular edifice, and stands on the site of an
earlier building.

Railway, situated in the valley of the Quin. It dates from Saxon
times, when it was known as Brooking; and it was granted a
market by Stephen. A Roman sarcophagus and many Roman
coins have been discovered in the parish. (<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> <a href="#Page_22" title="Go to page 22">22</a>, <a href="#Page_113" title="Go to page 113">113</a>, <a href="#Page_136" title="Go to page 136">136</a>.)</p>

<p><b>Broxbourne</b> (748) is also a village on the Great Eastern
Railway, to the south of Hoddesdon: it contains an almshouse for
poor widows founded in the year 1728. The village is intimately
connected with the Rye House Plot. (<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> <a href="#Page_128" title="Go to page 128">128</a>, <a href="#Page_142" title="Go to page 142">142</a>.)</p>

<p><b>Buntingford</b> (1272) is a market-town, with almshouses, on
a branch of the Great Eastern Railway running northwards from
Stortford. It was granted a market by Edward <abbr title="the Third">III</abbr>. (<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> <a href="#Page_54" title="Go to page 54">54</a>, <a href="#Page_128" title="Go to page 128">128</a>.)</p>

<p><b>Bushey</b> (2838), a parish in the south of the county, separated
from Watford about 1166. The village is now the site of the
Herkomer Art School. The church was “restored” in 1871,
when a late Gothic window was removed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span></p>

<p><b>Cheshunt</b> (12,292) is a large market-town in the south-eastern
corner of the county, nearly north-west of Waltham
Abbey, with a station on the Great Eastern and some distance
from the town itself. It is celebrated for its nursery gardens,
roses being especially cultivated. Within Cheshunt parish is
situated Theobald’s Park, at one time a royal residence. Cheshunt
Park is on the opposite, or north side of the town; and
near by are the remains of an old nunnery. (<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> <a href="#Page_43" title="Go to page 43">43</a>, <a href="#Page_99" title="Go to page 99">99</a>, <a href="#Page_100" title="Go to page 100">100</a>, <a href="#Page_128" title="Go to page 128">128</a>.)</p>

<p><b>Codicote</b> (1145), a small village to the north-west of
Welwyn. The church was an ancient one, but a drastic “restoration”
in 1853 destroyed much of the evidence of the age of its
constituent portions. (<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> <a href="#Page_43" title="Go to page 43">43</a>, <a href="#Page_128" title="Go to page 128">128</a>, <a href="#Page_130" title="Go to page 130">130</a>.)</p>

<p><b>Elstree</b> (1323), a village on the southern border of the

<p><b>Flamstead</b> (1039), a village near the Watling Street to the
north of Redbourn. The name is supposed to be a corruption of
Verlampstead, the Ver flowing in the valley below the village.
The Thomas Saunders almshouses were built in 1669. Beechwood,
the seat of the Sebright family is in the parish.</p>

<p><b>Great Gaddesden</b> (746), a village in Dacorum Hundred
to the north of Hemel Hempstead. Gaddesden Place, which was
burnt down in 1905 and rebuilt, is the seat of the Halsey family,
who possessed the neighbouring “Golden Parsonage” so long ago<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
as 1544. The church probably dates from the twelfth century.

<p><b>The Hadhams</b>&mdash;Much Hadham (1199), Little Hadham
(655)&mdash;two villages lying respectively to the south-west and
north-west of Bishop Stortford, and known to have been in
existence in the time of the Conqueror. The manor of Hadham
Hall was granted by the crown to the Bishops of London at the
time when the survey recorded in Domesday books was made.

<p><b>Harpenden</b> (4725), a large village or small town on the
Midland Railway, almost exactly half-way between <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans
and Luton. During the last twenty years Harpenden (<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>“the
valley of nightingales”) has nearly doubled in size, and is rapidly
increasing. Within the parish is the agricultural experiment-station
of Rothamsted; the laboratory being situated on the
borders of the village itself. About a mile to the north is Shire-Mere,
a small green partly in Hertfordshire and partly in
Bedfordshire, and in consequence a favourite site for prize-fights
in the old days. Harpenden has branch-lines connected with the
Great Northern and the North-Western Railways. With the
exception of the more modern tower, the church, which was
largely Norman, was pulled down and rebuilt in the sixties.
A Norman arch remains in the tower.

<p><b>Hatfield</b>, or <b>King’s Hatfield</b> (4330), is a small town on
the main line of the Great Northern Railway, chiefly noteworthy
on account of its connection with Hatfield House, the seat of the
Cecils, Marquises of Salisbury. As mentioned above, Hatfield was
at one time a royal palace; but the original building is now used as
a stable and riding-school, the present house being of Jacobean
date. The residence at Hatfield of Queen Elizabeth is connected
with the old palace. Among the features of Hatfield House are
the marble hall, its oak-panelled walls hung with tapestry, and its
panelled ceiling painted; the grand staircase, hung with portraits;
the long gallery, with its armour and pictures; King James’s
drawing-room, a magnificently decorated apartment; the great
dining-room, with a bust of Lord Burleigh; the armoury; and
the beautiful chapel, with its exquisite Flemish window and a
marble altar-piece. Hatfield is an important railway centre for
the county, the Great Northern having branches to Hertford,
<abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans, and Harpenden and Luton. Petty sessions are held in
the town. In the church are the monuments of the Cecil family,
and a statue of the late Lord Salisbury, erected by county subscription,
stands at the park entrance.

<p><b>Hemel Hempstead</b> (11,264) is an ancient borough and
market-town on the western side of the county connected with the
main line of the North-Western Railway at Boxmoor, and also
served by a branch joining the main line of the Midland at
Harpenden. In addition to a mayor, Hempstead has a borough
official known as the high bailiff<a name="Anchor_4" id="Anchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 4.">[4]</a>. The town, which is situated
in the Gade valley, and formerly returned members of its own to
Parliament, is remarkable for the length of its main street&mdash;part
of which is known as Marlowes. Its market-day is Thursday,
and there is an annual wool-sale. Corn and cattle are its chief
trade, the straw-plait industry having nearly died out; but near
by is Nash Mills, the site of a large paper factory. The
church, which stands to the west of the main street, is a fine
example of a cruciform twelfth-century parish church; it was
commenced about 1140 and finished some 40 years later. There
is no evidence of any earlier building on the site. (<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> <a href="#Page_43" title="Go to page 43">43</a>, <a href="#Page_47" title="Go to page 47">47</a>,

<p><b>Hertford</b> (9322), although by no means the largest town as
regards the number of its population, occupies the first place, as
being the county-town, and the only one in Hertfordshire where
assizes are held. It is also a market-town and borough (with a
mayor and corporation), and formerly returned members of its
own to Parliament, although now it is only the centre of a
parliamentary division of the county. In addition to the assizes
for the whole county, quarter-sessions for the eastern division of
Hertfordshire are held in the Shire Hall. The site of Hertford

Roxford was granted by William the Conqueror to Goisfrede
de Beck for good service rendered.</p>

<p><b>Hexton</b> (155), a village in a small parish of Cassio Hundred
on the north border of the county jutting into Bedfordshire.
Ancient coins have been found in the parish, which includes the

have been granted on two occasions to the monastery of <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Alban.</p>

<p><b>Hitchin</b> (10,072) is one of the most ancient towns in the
county, and is now an important railway centre, as it is the
starting point of the Royston and Cambridge branch of the Great
Northern Railway, on the main line of which the town itself is
situated. Hitchin is one of the four parliamentary centres of the
county, and is noted for its corn and cattle market, and also as
being one of the few places in England where lavender is cultivated
for commercial purposes. Hitchin preserves the remnant of an
ancient monastery in the almshouses known as the Biggin, and
teems with buildings and sites of antiquarian interest. Petty
sessions are held in the town. The parish church is one of great
beauty and interest, mainly of the Decorated and Perpendicular
styles. A picture of the Adoration of the Magi presented in
1774 is believed to be by Rubens.

<p><b>Rickmansworth</b> (5627), at the junction of the Colne, Gade,
and Chess rivers, is a town in the south-western corner of the
county, close to the Bucks and Middlesex borders. It has several
ancient almshouses, of which one dates from 1680. Immediately
to the south-east is Moor Park, the seat of Lord Ebury, where
Lord Anson formerly lived. This once belonged to the abbots
of <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans, but was given by Henry <abbr title="the Seventh">VII</abbr> to the Earl of Oxford,
and in the reign of Henry <abbr title="the Eight">VIII</abbr> was the property of Cardinal
Wolsey. The present house is of comparatively modern date.
The Bury is an excellent specimen of an early seventeenth century
mansion. The church appears to have been rebuilt in the fifteenth
century. Rickmeresworth was the old name of the town. There
are a number of manors in the parish. (<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> <a href="#Page_20" title="Go to page 20">20</a>, <a href="#Page_31" title="Go to page 31">31</a>, <a href="#Page_71" title="Go to page 71">71</a>, <a href="#Page_73" title="Go to page 73">73</a>,

a market, stands just at the foot of the chalk downs; it has the
honour of giving the name to one of the species, or races, of
British birds, to wit, the Royston crow. The church is that of
an Augustinian priory now demolished. James <abbr title="the First">I</abbr> had a hunting

<p><b><abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans</b> (16,019), situated about twenty miles north-west
of London by rail, enjoys the distinction of being the only
town in Hertfordshire entitled to style itself a “city.” It is the
direct modern successor of the Roman city of Verulamium, lying
on the opposite side of the Ver, and itself dates from Saxon times,
its ancient monastery having been founded by the Mercian king
Offa <abbr title="the Second">II</abbr> in 793, in memory of Alban, the first English Christian
martyr. The city has a mayor and corporation, and was formerly
a parliamentary borough in its own right, although at the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
day it forms the centre of an electoral district returning one
member to the House of Commons. It is also the centre of the
western division of Hertfordshire;&mdash;a division corresponding in
the main to the old Liberty of <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans, the area lying within
the jurisdiction of the abbot. Quarter-sessions for the western
division of the county are held in the Court House, and likewise
petty-sessions for the <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans division of the county, as well as
city petty-sessions for <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans itself. At these last the city
magistrates sit; the cases being brought before them by the local
police force, which is distinct from that of the county. The city
is the see of the bishopric of <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans, and its crowning glory
is its Abbey, now raised to the dignity of a cathedral. Offa’s
abbey was attacked and plundered by the Danes, and a rebuilding
of the monastic church was contemplated by Ealdred, the eighth
abbot, who collected building materials from Verulam. The
long-deferred work, on a new site, was however not undertaken
till the time of Paul of Caen, the first Norman abbot (1077–93).
This abbot rebuilt the church and nearly all the monastic buildings
with the materials collected by his predecessor; and apparently
made a clean sweep of the original structures. Although the
fabric appears to have been completed by Abbot Paul, the
consecration did not take place till 1115. Between 1195 and
1214 Abbot John de Cella commenced a new west front, but only
part of the original design was carried out. In 1257 the eastern
end was in a dangerous condition, and the two easternmost bays
were pulled down; and eventually a presbytery and a Lady
Chapel with vestibule were added. Extensive alterations and
rebuilding were carried out previous to 1326, and again between
1335 and 1340. Other works were carried out by John de
Wheathampstead between 1451 and 1484, including the rebuilding
of <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Andrew’s chapel. In 1553 the abbey was sold to the
Mayor and Burgesses as a parish church, when the Lady Chapel
was cut off from the rest of the building by a public passage and
used as a grammar school. This passage remained till about
1870, when the Lady Chapel was once more rejoined to the main
fabric. About this time a restoration of portions of the building
was undertaken by a county committee, when the low-pitched
roof of the nave was replaced by a high-pitched one on the lines
of a much earlier structure. Soon after, the tower was in danger
of collapsing, owing to crush in the supporting pillars, and the
whole structure had to be shored up previous to underpinning.
Finally, the late Lord Grimthorpe undertook the completion of
the “restoration,” which was carried out in substantial but drastic
style. His most notable work comprised the complete rebuilding
of the west front in a peculiar style, the repointing of the tower,
and the replacing of its brick turrets by stone “pepper-pots.”</p>

<p>The clock-tower in the centre of the city, from which the
curfew was rung till the sixties, is another interesting building,
as is also the old gateway of the monastery, now used as a
grammar school. Near by the city are the ruins of Sopwell
nunnery. The city has three parishes, those of the Abbey, <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr>
Peter, and <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Michael, but it is also extending into the parish
of Sandridge. On the further side of the Ver is situated <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr>
Stephen’s. <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Albans is rapidly increasing as a residential district,
and also as a manufacturing centre, a number of industrial
establishments from London having been recently set up in its
environs. Straw-plait still remains, however, the chief trade,
although the actual plaiting of the straw has been killed by
foreign competition. A market is held every Saturday. <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr>
Albans has a museum, unfortunately not restricted to local
antiquities and natural history objects. There are three railway
stations, one on the Midland, the second the terminus of a
branch line from the North-Western at Watford, and the third
that of a branch of the Great Northern from Hatfield. <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Peter’s
church stands on the site of a Saxon church built in the latter
half of the tenth century; this was replaced in less than 200 years
by a Norman edifice, remains of which were found during the
alterations carried out by the late Lord Grimthorpe. <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Michael’s
church contains Bacon’s tomb.</p>

<p><b>Watton</b> or <b>Watton-at-Stone</b> (710), a village in the
valley of the Beane, near the centre of the county, taking its
name from the number of springs in the neighbourhood&mdash;<i>Wat</i>, in
Saxon, signifying a moist place. Watton, which was in existence
as a manor in the time of the Conqueror, was the home of the
ancient family of Boteler, whose seat was the present Woodhall
Park, now the property of the Abel Smith family. Near by is
the manor house of Aston Bury, a fine example of a sixteenth
century house, also once belonging to the Botelers, with tall,
twisted chimneys, a magnificent staircase, and an upper room
occupying the whole width of the building. (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> <a href="#Page_113" title="Go to page 113">113</a>.)</p>

<p><b>Welwyn</b> (1660), a village on the Great Northern Railway
between Hatfield and Stevenage. Young, who was born near
Bishop’s Waltham in Hampshire, became Rector of the place,
wrote his <cite>Night Thoughts</cite> here, and is buried in the churchyard.
Two centuries ago Welwyn was celebrated for its chalybeate
springs. (<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> <a href="#Page_62" title="Go to page 62">62</a>, <a href="#Page_128" title="Go to page 128">128</a>, <a href="#Page_149" title="Go to page 149">149</a>.)</p>

<p><b>Wheathampstead</b> (2405), a village in the valley of the
Lea, between Luton and Hatfield, with a station on the Luton and
Dunstable branch of the Great Northern Railway. The parish
originally included Harpenden, which was separated about 1860.
One of the oldest buildings is Wheathampstead Place, or Place
Farm, which dates back to the time of Queen Elizabeth, and has
some fine Tudor chimneys; it was formerly the property of the
Brockett family, whose monuments are in the church. The
church itself, which is a cruciform edifice with a central tower,
is dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Helen, and was judiciously restored in the
sixties; the chancel with its three beautiful lancet windows was
built about 1230, the tower was rebuilt towards the close of the
thirteenth century, and the north transept between 1330–40.
The parish includes the manors of Mackery End and Lamer; the
latter taking its name from the de la Mare family, by whom
it was held in the fourteenth century. Lamer House was rebuilt
about 1761. (<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> <a href="#Page_38" title="Go to page 38">38</a>, <a href="#Page_67" title="Go to page 67">67</a>, <a href="#Page_90" title="Go to page 90">90</a>, <a href="#Page_97" title="Go to page 97">97</a>, <a href="#Page_101" title="Go to page 101">101</a>.)</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access

  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If

without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
